# Input and Output Streams in C

In C programming, input and output (I/O) operations are essential for interacting with the user and external devices. The standard I/O library in C provides functions to perform input and output operations using streams.

## 1. Standard Input and Output Streams

C provides three standard streams for input and output operations:

- **stdin**: Standard input stream, typically used for reading input from the keyboard.
- **stdout**: Standard output stream, typically used for writing output to the screen.
- **stderr**: Standard error stream, typically used for writing error messages to the screen.

## 2. Input Functions

### `scanf`

The `scanf` function is used to read formatted input from the standard input stream (stdin). The syntax is:

```c
scanf(format_string, &variable1, &variable2, ...);
```

## 3. Output Functions

### `printf`

The `printf` function is used to write formatted output to the standard output stream (stdout). The syntax is:

```c
printf(format_string, value1, value2, ...);
```

## Complete Example

Here is a complete example demonstrating the use of `scanf` for input and `printf` for output in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);
    printf("You entered: %d\n", number);
    return 0;
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char name[50];
    int age;

    printf("Enter your name: ");
    scanf("%s", name);

    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);

    printf("Hello, %s! You are %d years old.\n", name, age);

    return 0;
}

```

This program prompts the user to enter a number and then displays the number entered by the user.

## 4. Advantages of Input and Output Functions

Input and output functions in C, such as `scanf` and `printf`, offer several advantages:

1. **User Interaction**: These functions enable user interaction by allowing the program to read input from the user and display output. This makes the program more dynamic and interactive.

2. **Formatted Output**: The `printf` function provides a powerful way to format output. You can control the appearance of the output by specifying format specifiers, making it easier to present data in a readable and organized manner.

3. **Versatility**: Input and output functions support various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and strings. This versatility allows you to handle different types of data efficiently.

4. **Error Handling**: By checking the return values of input functions like `scanf`, you can implement error handling to ensure that the input is valid. This helps in creating robust and reliable programs.

5. **Portability**: The `scanf` and `printf` functions are part of the C standard library, making them portable across different platforms and compilers. This ensures that your code can run on various systems without modification.

6. **Ease of Use**: These functions are easy to use and understand, making them accessible to both beginners and experienced programmers. The straightforward syntax allows for quick implementation of input and output operations.

7. **Efficiency**: Input and output functions are optimized for performance, allowing for efficient reading and writing of data. This is particularly important in programs that require frequent input and output operations.

By leveraging the advantages of input and output functions, you can create interactive, user-friendly, and efficient C programs that handle data effectively.

## 5. Conclusion

The `scanf` and `printf` functions are fundamental for input and output operations in C. They allow you to read and display data in various formats, making them essential for creating interactive and dynamic programs.
