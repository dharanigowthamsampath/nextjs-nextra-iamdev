# Using `with` Statement in File Handling

In Python, the `with` statement is the **recommended way** to work with files. It ensures that:

Files are **automatically closed** after use
You don’t forget to call `file.close()`
Your code is **cleaner and safer**

This is also known as a **context manager**.

---

## Why Use `with`?

Without `with`, you must manually close the file:

```python filename="manual_close.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
file = open("data.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()
```

❌ Problem: If an error occurs before `file.close()`, the file may stay open.

---

### Better: Using `with`

```python filename="with_basic.py" {2, 3, 4}
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

**Benefits:**

- File is **automatically closed** even if an error occurs
- Code is **cleaner and shorter**
- Safer for **large-scale applications**

---

## Anatomy of `with` Statement

```python filename="with_structure.py" {1}
with open("filename", "mode") as file_object:
    # do something with file_object
```

---

## Example 1: Reading a File Safely

```python filename="with_read.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
with open("readme.txt", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line.strip())
```

**Explanation:**
You don’t need to call `f.close()` — it’s handled automatically.

---

## Example 2: Writing to a File

```python filename="with_write.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
with open("notes.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("First line.\n")
    file.write("Second line.\n")
```

**Explanation:**
Content is written, and the file is properly closed.

---

## Example 3: Appending to a File

```python filename="with_append.py" {2, 3, 4}
with open("notes.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("Appended line.\n")
```

**Explanation:**
Appends without affecting previous content.

---

## Example 4: Reading and Writing (`r+` mode)

```python filename="with_rplus.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
with open("notes.txt", "r+") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("Before:", content)
    file.seek(0)
    file.write("Updated content.\n")
```

**Explanation:**

- Reads the content
- Then **overwrites** the beginning
- Still safely closed

---

## Example 5: Reading a Binary File

```python filename="with_binary_read.py" {2, 3, 4}
with open("photo.jpg", "rb") as image:
    data = image.read(10)
    print(data)
```

**Explanation:**
`rb` mode reads **raw bytes**, ideal for non-text files.

---

## Example 6: Writing a Binary File

```python filename="with_binary_write.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
with open("photo_copy.jpg", "wb") as new_img:
    with open("photo.jpg", "rb") as original:
        new_img.write(original.read())
```

**Explanation:**
Nested `with` handles **multiple files** safely.

---

## Using `with` for Multiple Files

```python filename="with_multiple_files.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
with open("file1.txt", "r") as f1, open("file2.txt", "w") as f2:
    content = f1.read()
    f2.write(content)
```

**Explanation:**
You can open **multiple files** in one line using commas.

---

## Summary

`with` is the **safest and cleanest** way to handle files in Python
No need to call `close()` manually
Works with **text and binary** files
Supports **multiple files** in one block
Highly recommended in **all professional Python projects**
