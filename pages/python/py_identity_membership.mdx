# Membership and Identity Operators in Python

Python provides two special types of operators:

1. **Membership Operators**: Test whether a value is part of a sequence (such as string, list, tuple, or set).
2. **Identity Operators**: Compare the memory locations of two objects.

These operators help write **clean, readable, and efficient code** when checking for existence or object identity.

## 1. Membership Operators

| Operator | Description                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `in`     | Returns `True` if a value is present in a sequence     |
| `not in` | Returns `True` if a value is NOT present in a sequence |

### Example 1: Using `in` with a List

```python filename="membership_in_list.py" {2, 3}
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("banana" in fruits)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
True
```

### Example 2: Using `not in` with a String

```python filename="membership_not_in_string.py" {2, 3}
sentence = "Python is fun"
print("Java" not in sentence)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
True
```

### Explanation:

- `in` checks if the value is in the sequence (string, list, tuple, set, or dictionary keys).
- `not in` checks if the value is absent.

## 2. Identity Operators

| Operator | Description                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `is`     | Returns `True` if two variables point to the same object in memory |
| `is not` | Returns `True` if two variables do NOT point to the same object    |

### Example 1: Using `is` with Variables

```python filename="identity_is.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x
print(x is y)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
True
```

### Explanation:

- `y` points to the same object as `x`.
- `is` compares **identity**, not just value.

---

### Example 2: `is not` with Separate Objects

```python filename="identity_is_not.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]
print(x is not y)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
True
```

### Explanation:

- Even though `x` and `y` have the same **value**, they are **different objects**.
- Their identity (memory location) is different.

---

### Example 3: Using `is` with Immutable Objects (Integers)

```python filename="identity_integers.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
a = 100
b = 100
print(a is b)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
True
```

### Explanation:

- For **small integers** (typically between `-5` and `256`), Python caches objects.
- So `a` and `b` may point to the same object.

---

### Example 4: `is` with Strings

```python filename="identity_strings.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
s1 = "hello"
s2 = "hello"
print(s1 is s2)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
True
```

### Explanation:

- Short string literals are often cached by Python.
- `is` may return `True` for such strings.

## Summary

- **Membership Operators**:

  - `in`: Checks if a value exists in a sequence.
  - `not in`: Checks if a value does not exist.

- **Identity Operators**:

  - `is`: Checks if two references point to the same object.
  - `is not`: Checks if they do not.

- **Use cases**:

  - Membership: Useful for searching within collections.
  - Identity: Useful for checking object identity (especially when working with **mutable objects**, **None**, or **singleton patterns**).
