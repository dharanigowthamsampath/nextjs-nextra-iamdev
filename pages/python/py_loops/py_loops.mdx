# Loops in Python – `for` Loop

The **`for` loop** in Python is used to iterate over a **sequence of elements** such as lists, strings, tuples, ranges, dictionaries, and sets.

It is ideal when you know **how many elements** you want to process — and it's one of the most commonly used loop structures in Python.

## Basic Syntax of `for` Loop

```python filename="for_syntax.py" {2, 3, 4}
for item in sequence:
    # block of code
```

### Explanation:

- The loop **extracts one item at a time** from the sequence.
- The item is assigned to the variable `item`.
- The loop runs until **all elements** have been processed.

---

## Example 1: Iterating Over a List

```python filename="for_list.py" {2, 3, 4}
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print("I like", fruit)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
I like apple
I like banana
I like cherry
```

### Explanation:

- The loop **automatically picks one element** from the list on each iteration.
- Very readable and simple to use with sequences like lists.

---

## Example 2: Iterating Over a String

```python filename="for_string.py" {2, 3, 4}
word = "Python"

for char in word:
    print(char)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
P
y
t
h
o
n
```

### Explanation:

- Strings are sequences of characters — the `for` loop processes them one character at a time.

---

## Example 3: Using `range()` for Numeric Sequences

```python filename="for_range.py" {2, 3, 4}
for i in range(1, 6):
    print("Number:", i)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Number: 5
```

### Explanation:

- `range(start, stop)` generates a sequence of numbers from `start` to `stop - 1`.
- Perfect for loops that **count** or repeat a set number of times.

---

## Example 4: Loop With Step Value

```python filename="for_range_step.py" {2, 3, 4}
for i in range(0, 11, 2):
    print("Even:", i)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Even: 0
Even: 2
Even: 4
Even: 6
Even: 8
Even: 10
```

### Explanation:

- The third argument in `range(start, stop, step)` controls how much the counter increases on each iteration.
- Used to iterate with custom step sizes.

---

## Example 5: Looping Over a Tuple

```python filename="for_tuple.py" {2, 3, 4}
person = ("Alice", 30, "Engineer")

for detail in person:
    print(detail)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Alice
30
Engineer
```

### Explanation:

- Works on **any iterable** — lists, tuples, sets, strings, dictionaries, etc.

---

## Example 6: Nested `for` Loops – Multiplication Table

```python filename="for_nested.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(f"{i} x {j} = {i * j}", end="\t")
    print()
```

```python filename="output.txt"
1 x 1 = 1	1 x 2 = 2	1 x 3 = 3
2 x 1 = 2	2 x 2 = 4	2 x 3 = 6
3 x 1 = 3	3 x 2 = 6	3 x 3 = 9
```

### Explanation:

- **Nested loops** allow you to create multi-dimensional patterns.
- Outer loop controls rows; inner loop controls columns.

---

## Example 7: Looping Over a Dictionary

```python filename="for_dict.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
info = {"name": "John", "age": 28, "city": "New York"}

for key, value in info.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

```python filename="output.txt"
name: John
age: 28
city: New York
```

### Explanation:

- The `.items()` method returns key-value pairs from the dictionary.
- **Dictionary iteration** is a common pattern in Python programs.

---

## Example 8: Loop With `break` and `continue`

```python filename="for_break_continue.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

for num in numbers:
    if num == 4:
        continue  # Skip this iteration
    if num == 6:
        break  # Exit the loop
    print(num)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
1
2
3
5
```

### Explanation:

- `continue` skips the current iteration.
- `break` exits the loop entirely.
- Helps manage loop flow.

## When to Use `for` vs `while`

| Use Case                              | `for` Loop      | `while` Loop            |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Known number of iterations            | Yes             | Possible but less clear |
| Iterating over a sequence (list, str) | Yes (preferred) | Possible but awkward    |
| Input validation, waiting for event   | Less common     | Preferred               |
| Infinite loops with manual exit       | Possible        | Common                  |

---

## Summary

- The `for` loop is **designed for iteration** — over any sequence or iterable.
- It works well with **lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings, ranges**, and more.
- It is **clear, simple, and readable** — ideal for processing each element of a collection.
- Use **`break`** and **`continue`** to control loop flow.
- Combine with **nested loops** for advanced structures.

In the next topic, we will explore **loop control statements** in greater depth: `break`, `continue`, and `else` with loops — and how they allow you to build more flexible logic inside loops.
