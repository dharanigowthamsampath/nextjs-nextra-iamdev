# Loop Control Statements in Python

Python provides special statements to **control the flow** of loops — making them more flexible and powerful:

1. `break` – exit the loop entirely
2. `continue` – skip the current iteration
3. `else` – run a block **after the loop ends**, unless the loop was exited with `break`

These can be used in both **`for` loops** and **`while` loops**.

---

## Example 1: The `break` Statement

`break` is used to **immediately stop** the loop, regardless of the loop condition or sequence.

```python filename="break_example.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
for num in range(1, 10):
    if num == 5:
        break
    print(num)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
1
2
3
4
```

### Explanation:

- The loop starts at `1`.
- When `num == 5`, the `break` statement **exits the loop**.
- The loop prints only `1` to `4`.

---

## Example 2: The `continue` Statement

`continue` is used to **skip the rest of the current iteration** and go to the next loop cycle.

```python filename="continue_example.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
for num in range(1, 6):
    if num == 3:
        continue
    print(num)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
1
2
4
5
```

### Explanation:

- The loop skips printing `3` and continues with `4` and `5`.

---

## Example 3: The `else` Clause With Loops

An `else` block can be attached to a loop:

- It runs **after the loop finishes normally** (without `break`).
- If the loop **exits with `break`**, the `else` block is skipped.

```python filename="else_for.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
for i in range(1, 4):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed without break")
```

```python filename="output.txt"
1
2
3
Loop completed without break
```

### Explanation:

- The loop runs all iterations — so the `else` runs.

---

## Example 4: Using `break` and `else` Together

```python filename="break_else.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 4:
        print("Breaking at", i)
        break
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop finished without break")
```

```python filename="output.txt"
1
2
3
Breaking at 4
```

### Explanation:

- The loop exits with `break`, so the `else` block is **not run**.

---

## Example 5: `while` Loop With `break`

```python filename="while_break.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
count = 0
while True:
    count += 1
    print("Count:", count)
    if count == 3:
        break
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
```

### Explanation:

- The loop is **infinite (`while True`)**.
- The loop is stopped by `break` when count reaches `3`.

---

## Example 6: Skipping Odd Numbers With `continue`

```python filename="while_continue.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
i = 0
while i < 6:
    i += 1
    if i % 2 != 0:
        continue
    print(i)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
2
4
6
```

### Explanation:

- Odd numbers are skipped using `continue`.
- Even numbers are printed.

## When to Use Loop Control Statements

| Statement  | Purpose                                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `break`    | Stop loop early when a condition is met (exit loop)                     |
| `continue` | Skip current iteration, continue with next                              |
| `else`     | Run only when loop completes without break (useful for search patterns) |

---

## Summary

- `break`, `continue`, and `else` give you **full control** of loop behavior.
- They can be used in both `for` and `while` loops.
- Use `break` to exit early, `continue` to skip an iteration, and `else` to handle post-loop actions.
