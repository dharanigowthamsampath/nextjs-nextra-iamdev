# Loops in Python – `while` Loop

A **loop** allows you to execute a block of code **repeatedly** as long as a certain condition is met.

The `while` loop in Python is used when you want to **repeat an action an unknown number of times** — until a condition becomes false.

---

## Basic Syntax of `while` Loop

```python filename="while_syntax.py" {2, 3, 4}
while condition:
    # block of code
```

### Explanation:

- The `condition` is checked **before** each iteration.
- If **True**, the block is executed.
- If **False**, the loop ends.

---

## Example 1: Simple Counter

```python filename="while_counter.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

### Explanation:

- The loop runs until `count` exceeds 5.
- `count += 1` increments the counter each time.

---

## Example 2: Input Validation Loop

```python filename="while_input_validation.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
password = ""

while password != "python123":
    password = input("Enter the password: ")

print("Access granted!")
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Enter the password: abc
Enter the password: 123
Enter the password: python123
Access granted!
```

### Explanation:

- The loop keeps asking for input until the correct password is entered.
- Very useful in **login systems** or **user input validation**.

---

## Example 3: Summing Numbers Until Zero

```python filename="while_sum.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
total = 0
num = int(input("Enter a number (0 to stop): "))

while num != 0:
    total += num
    num = int(input("Enter a number (0 to stop): "))

print("Total sum:", total)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Enter a number (0 to stop): 5
Enter a number (0 to stop): 3
Enter a number (0 to stop): 2
Enter a number (0 to stop): 0
Total sum: 10
```

### Explanation:

- The loop reads numbers from the user.
- It continues adding them to `total` until the user enters 0.

---

## Example 4: Generating a Multiplication Table

```python filename="while_multiplication.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
num = 7
i = 1

while i <= 10:
    print(f"{num} x {i} = {num * i}")
    i += 1
```

```python filename="output.txt"
7 x 1 = 7
7 x 2 = 14
7 x 3 = 21
...
7 x 10 = 70
```

### Explanation:

- This generates a multiplication table up to 10.
- A common beginner task that demonstrates controlled repetition.

---

## Example 5: Factorial of a Number

```python filename="while_factorial.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
num = 5
factorial = 1

while num > 0:
    factorial *= num
    num -= 1

print("Factorial:", factorial)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Factorial: 120
```

### Explanation:

- This computes **n!** using a `while` loop.
- It demonstrates use of **decrementing** in a loop.

---

## Example 6: Infinite Loop with `break`

```python filename="while_infinite_break.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
while True:
    choice = input("Continue (y/n)? ")
    if choice == "n":
        break
    print("Looping...")
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Continue (y/n)? y
Looping...
Continue (y/n)? y
Looping...
Continue (y/n)? n
```

### Explanation:

- The loop is designed to run **forever** (`while True`).
- The `break` statement is used to exit the loop when needed.
- Useful in **menu-driven applications** or **interactive scripts**.

---

## Example 7: Nested `while` Loop – Multiplication Grid

```python filename="while_nested.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
i = 1

while i <= 3:
    j = 1
    while j <= 3:
        print(f"{i} x {j} = {i * j}", end="\t")
        j += 1
    print()
    i += 1
```

```python filename="output.txt"
1 x 1 = 1    1 x 2 = 2    1 x 3 = 3
2 x 1 = 2    2 x 2 = 4    2 x 3 = 6
3 x 1 = 3    3 x 2 = 6    3 x 3 = 9
```

### Explanation:

- A **nested while loop** allows creating multi-dimensional structures.
- The outer loop controls rows, inner loop controls columns.
- Demonstrates **nested iteration**.

---

## Summary

- The `while` loop runs **as long as the condition is True**.
- It is perfect when you don't know **ahead of time** how many iterations you need.
- It works well for **input validation**, **reading data**, **menu-driven programs**, **computing series**, and **generating sequences**.
- Be careful of **infinite loops** — always ensure the loop will eventually stop.
- Complex structures can be built with **nested while loops**.

Next, we will explore the **`for` loop** — designed for iterating over **sequences** like lists, strings, tuples, and ranges.
