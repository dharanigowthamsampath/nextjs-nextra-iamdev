# File Modes in Python

**File mode** determines **how** a file is opened in Python:
For **reading**
For **writing**
For **appending**
For **binary** access
And more...

Choosing the correct mode is critical for safe and correct file handling.

## File Modes Overview

| Mode   | Description                                              |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `'r'`  | Read-only (default). File must exist.                    |
| `'w'`  | Write-only. Creates new file or **overwrites** existing. |
| `'a'`  | Append-only. Creates new file or appends to existing.    |
| `'r+'` | Read + write. File must exist.                           |
| `'w+'` | Write + read. Overwrites existing or creates new file.   |
| `'a+'` | Append + read. Creates new or appends.                   |
| `'b'`  | Binary mode (e.g., `'rb'`, `'wb'`)                       |
| `'x'`  | Exclusive creation — fails if file exists.               |

## Example 1: `'r'` — Read Mode

```python filename="file_mode_r.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    print(file.read())
```

**Notes:**

- Opens file for **reading**
- File must exist, otherwise error:
  `FileNotFoundError`

---

## Example 2: `'w'` — Write Mode

```python filename="file_mode_w.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
with open("newfile.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This will create a new file or overwrite existing.")
```

**Notes:**

- Creates `newfile.txt` if not present
- **Overwrites** content if file exists

---

## Example 3: `'a'` — Append Mode

```python filename="file_mode_a.py" {2, 3, 4}
with open("newfile.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("\nAppending another line.")
```

**Notes:**

- Adds content to end of file
- Does **not overwrite**

---

## Example 4: `'r+'` — Read and Write (existing file)

```python filename="file_mode_rplus.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
with open("example.txt", "r+") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("Before:", content)
    file.seek(0)
    file.write("Updated first line.\n")
```

**Notes:**

- File must exist
- Allows **both reading and writing**

---

## Example 5: `'w+'` — Write and Read (overwrite)

```python filename="file_mode_wplus.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
with open("newfile2.txt", "w+") as file:
    file.write("New content here.\n")
    file.seek(0)
    print("After write:", file.read())
```

**Notes:**

- **Overwrites** or creates file
- Can **read** and **write**

---

## Example 6: `'a+'` — Append and Read

```python filename="file_mode_aplus.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
with open("newfile2.txt", "a+") as file:
    file.write("Appending again!\n")
    file.seek(0)
    print("File content:\n", file.read())
```

**Notes:**

- Appends content
- Can also read

---

## Example 7: `'x'` — Exclusive Creation

```python filename="file_mode_x.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
with open("unique.txt", "x") as file:
    file.write("File created uniquely.")
```

**Notes:**

- Fails if file already exists:
  `FileExistsError`

---

## Binary Modes: `'rb'`, `'wb'`

Used for **non-text** files:
Images
Audio/video
Executables

---

### Example 8: Reading Binary File

```python filename="file_mode_rb.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
with open("image.png", "rb") as file:
    data = file.read(10)
    print(data)
```

**Notes:**

- `'rb'` — read **binary**
- Returns bytes, not strings

---

### Example 9: Writing Binary File

```python filename="file_mode_wb.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
with open("copy_image.png", "wb") as file:
    with open("image.png", "rb") as original:
        file.write(original.read())
```

**Notes:**

- `'wb'` — write **binary**
- Can copy image/audio files

---

## Summary

File **mode** controls how files are opened:

- Read (`'r'`)
- Write (`'w'`)
- Append (`'a'`)
- Combined read/write (`'r+'`, `'w+'`, `'a+'`)
- Exclusive create (`'x'`)
- Binary (`'rb'`, `'wb'`)

Always choose the mode appropriate for your use case
Using `with open()` ensures safe file handling

Next, we will learn about **Using `with` Statement** — how it makes file handling safer and more readable.
