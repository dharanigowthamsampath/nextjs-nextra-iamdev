# Inheritance in Python

**Inheritance** is a powerful feature of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** that allows a class to **reuse** or **extend** functionality from another class.

With inheritance:

You can define a **base class** (also called parent or super class).
Other classes (child or derived classes) can **inherit** attributes and methods from the base class.
You can **add new features** or **override** existing behavior in the child class.

## Why Use Inheritance?

| Benefit             | Example                                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Code Reuse          | Common functionality shared across classes            |
| Avoid Duplication   | Write once, use everywhere                            |
| Logical Hierarchies | Natural relationship between base and derived classes |
| Extensibility       | Easily add new behavior without modifying base class  |

## Basic Syntax of Inheritance

```python filename="inheritance_syntax.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
class BaseClass:
    # base class code

class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    # derived class code
```

---

## Example 1: Simple Inheritance

```python filename="example1_simple_inheritance.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("This animal makes a sound.")

class Dog(Animal):
    pass

d = Dog()
d.sound()
```

```python filename="output.txt"
This animal makes a sound.
```

**Explanation:**
`Dog` class inherits the `sound()` method from the `Animal` class — no need to redefine it.

---

## Example 2: Adding New Methods in Derived Class

```python filename="example2_add_method.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("This animal makes a sound.")

class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        print("Woof! Woof!")

dog1 = Dog()
dog1.sound()
dog1.bark()
```

```python filename="output.txt"
This animal makes a sound.
Woof! Woof!
```

---

## Example 3: Overriding Methods

```python filename="example3_override.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("Generic animal sound.")

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Meow!")

c = Cat()
c.sound()
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Meow!
```

**Explanation:**
The `Cat` class overrides the `sound()` method of the base `Animal` class.

---

## Example 4: Using `super()` to Call Parent Method

```python filename="example4_super.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("Generic animal sound.")

class Bird(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        super().sound()
        print("Chirp! Chirp!")

b = Bird()
b.sound()
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Generic animal sound.
Chirp! Chirp!
```

**Explanation:**
The `super()` function allows the derived class to call the parent class’s method.

---

## Example 5: Inheriting Constructor

```python filename="example5_inherit_constructor.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def introduce(self):
        print(f"My name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

class Student(Person):
    def study(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is studying.")

s = Student("Alice", 21)
s.introduce()
s.study()
```

```python filename="output.txt"
My name is Alice and I am 21 years old.
Alice is studying.
```

---

## Example 6: Multi-level Inheritance

```python filename="example6_multilevel.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}
class Animal:
    def breathe(self):
        print("Breathing...")

class Mammal(Animal):
    def feed_milk(self):
        print("Feeding milk...")

class Human(Mammal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Speaking...")

h = Human()
h.breathe()
h.feed_milk()
h.speak()
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Breathing...
Feeding milk...
Speaking...
```

## Key Points

Inheritance allows one class to use **attributes and methods** of another class.
`super()` can call parent methods.
Child classes can:

- Inherit as-is
- Extend with new methods
- Override parent methods
  You can create **multi-level inheritance** — child of a child of a parent.

---

## Summary

- **Inheritance** promotes **code reuse** and **modularity**.
- A child class can inherit attributes and methods from a parent.
- Inheritance allows building **hierarchies** and **extending functionality**.
- You can **override** methods and call parent methods using `super()`.

Next, we will explore **Encapsulation** — a key principle for controlling access to object data and improving software design.
