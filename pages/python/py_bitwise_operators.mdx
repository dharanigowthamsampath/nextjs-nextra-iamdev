# Bitwise Operators in Python

**Bitwise operators** perform operations on integers at the level of individual bits. They treat the values as binary numbers (sequences of 0s and 1s) and operate on their bits.

Bitwise operations are useful in **low-level programming**, **cryptography**, **networking**, **game development**, and situations where you need fast manipulation of flags and bitfields.

## List of Bitwise Operators

| Operator    | Symbol | Description                                |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| AND         | `&`    | Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1      |
| OR          | `\|`   | Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1 |
| XOR         | `^`    | Sets each bit to 1 if only one bit is 1    |
| NOT         | `~`    | Inverts all bits (bitwise complement)      |
| Left Shift  | `<<`   | Shifts bits to the left (multiply by 2ⁿ)   |
| Right Shift | `>>`   | Shifts bits to the right (divide by 2ⁿ)    |

## 1. Bitwise AND (`&`)

```python filename="bitwise_and.py" {2, 3}
a = 5      # 0101 in binary
b = 3      # 0011 in binary
result = a & b
print(result)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
1
```

### Explanation:

- Binary of 5: `0101`
- Binary of 3: `0011`
- Result: `0001` (decimal 1)

---

## 2. Bitwise OR (`|`)

```python filename="bitwise_or.py" {2, 3}
a = 5      # 0101
b = 3      # 0011
result = a | b
print(result)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
7
```

### Explanation:

- Result: `0111` → decimal `7`

---

## 3. Bitwise XOR (`^`)

```python filename="bitwise_xor.py" {2, 3}
a = 5      # 0101
b = 3      # 0011
result = a ^ b
print(result)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
6
```

### Explanation:

- XOR sets bits to 1 where bits are different:
- Result: `0110` → decimal `6`

---

## 4. Bitwise NOT (`~`)

```python filename="bitwise_not.py" {2, 3}
a = 5
result = ~a
print(result)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
-6
```

### Explanation:

- Bitwise NOT inverts all bits and returns the **two’s complement** of the result.
- For 5 → `~5` = `-(5 + 1)` = `-6`.

---

## 5. Left Shift (`<<`)

```python filename="bitwise_left_shift.py" {2, 3}
a = 5    # 0101
result = a << 1
print(result)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
10
```

### Example 2:

```python filename="bitwise_left_shift_2.py" {2, 3}
a = 3    # 0011
result = a << 2
print(result)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
12
```

### Explanation:

- Left shift moves bits to the left and fills with zeros — multiplying by 2ⁿ.

---

## 6. Right Shift (`>>`)

```python filename="bitwise_right_shift.py" {2, 3}
a = 8    # 1000
result = a >> 1
print(result)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
4
```

### Example 2:

```python filename="bitwise_right_shift_2.py" {2, 3}
a = 10   # 1010
result = a >> 2
print(result)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
2
```

### Explanation:

- Right shift moves bits to the right — dividing by 2ⁿ (integer division).

---

## Practical Example: Using Bitwise Flags

```python filename="bitwise_flags.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
READ = 0b0001   # 1
WRITE = 0b0010  # 2
EXECUTE = 0b0100 # 4

permissions = READ | WRITE
print("Can read:", permissions & READ != 0)
print("Can execute:", permissions & EXECUTE != 0)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Can read: True
Can execute: False
```

### Explanation:

- Using bitwise flags helps in representing combinations of states efficiently.
- We can test for a specific permission using `&`.
