# Lambda Functions in Python

In Python, a **lambda function** is a small, anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword.
Unlike regular functions created with `def`, lambda functions are typically used for **simple, one-line operations**.

Lambda functions are useful when you need a quick function — especially when passing functions as arguments.

---

## Syntax of Lambda Function

```python filename="lambda_syntax.py" {2, 3}
lambda arguments: expression
```

- `lambda` — keyword to define the anonymous function.
- `arguments` — one or more parameters.
- `expression` — a single expression whose result is returned.

Lambda functions do not contain multiple statements or complex logic — they must be written in one line.

---

## Example 1: Basic Lambda Function

```python filename="lambda_basic.py" {2, 3, 4}
square = lambda x: x * x
print(square(5))
```

```python filename="output.txt"
25
```

Explanation:

- `lambda x: x * x` defines an anonymous function that returns the square of `x`.
- The function is assigned to `square` and called like a normal function.

---

## Example 2: Lambda with Two Parameters

```python filename="lambda_two_params.py" {2, 3, 4}
add = lambda a, b: a + b
print(add(3, 7))
```

```python filename="output.txt"
10
```

Explanation:

- Lambda function with two arguments: `a` and `b`.
- Returns their sum.

---

## Example 3: Using Lambda with `map()`

```python filename="lambda_map.py" {2, 3, 4}
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = list(map(lambda x: x * x, nums))
print(squares)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
[1, 4, 9, 16]
```

Explanation:

- `map()` applies the lambda function to every element in the list.
- The result is a list of squared numbers.

---

## Example 4: Using Lambda with `filter()`

```python filename="lambda_filter.py" {2, 3, 4}
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums))
print(even)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
[2, 4, 6]
```

Explanation:

- `filter()` applies the lambda function to each element.
- It returns only those elements that satisfy the condition.

---

## Example 5: Lambda Inside Sorted

```python filename="lambda_sorted.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
sorted_names = sorted(names, key=lambda name: len(name))
print(sorted_names)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
['Bob', 'Alice', 'David', 'Charlie']
```

Explanation:

- Lambda function used as `key` in `sorted()`.
- Sorts names based on their length.

---

## Example 6: Lambda with Default Parameter

```python filename="lambda_default.py" {2, 3, 4}
greet = lambda name="Guest": f"Hello, {name}"
print(greet())
print(greet("Alice"))
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Hello, Guest
Hello, Alice
```

Explanation:

- You can use **default parameters** in a lambda function.

## When to Use Lambda Functions

| Use Case                          | Example                                 |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Simple, one-line transformations  | `map()`, `filter()`, `sorted()`         |
| Passing function as argument      | Higher-order functions                  |
| Quick, throwaway functions        | Short anonymous operations              |
| Avoiding full function definition | Save lines of code when logic is simple |

---

## Limitations of Lambda Functions

- Can only contain **one expression** (no statements, no multiple lines).
- Cannot include assignments or complex logic.
- Readability may suffer if overused for complex operations.

---

## Summary

- Lambda functions are **anonymous, one-line functions** created with `lambda`.
- They are ideal for short, simple tasks.
- Commonly used with `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.
- For complex logic, prefer regular functions using `def`.
