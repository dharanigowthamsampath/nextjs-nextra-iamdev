# Syntax and Indentation in Python

Unlike many programming languages that use braces `{}` or keywords to define code blocks, **Python uses indentation** as a core part of its syntax. This unique feature makes Python code more readable and consistent, but it also means that **proper indentation is not optional — it is mandatory**.

In this section, we’ll explore Python’s syntax rules and how indentation defines the structure and flow of a Python program.

---

### 1. Python’s Clean Syntax

Python’s syntax is designed to be clear and human-readable. Statements end with newlines rather than semicolons (though semicolons are allowed, they are not recommended). Curly braces `{}` are not used for grouping code blocks. Instead, Python relies on **indentation levels** to determine block structure.

Here’s a simple example:

```python filename="greeting.py" {2, 3}
name = "Alice"
print("Hello,", name)
```

There’s no need to declare variable types (`name` is automatically recognized as a string), and there are no trailing semicolons.

### 2. The Role of Indentation

**Indentation is not just for readability — it defines the code structure.** All statements within the same block of code must be indented the same amount.

A block typically follows structures like `if`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `class`, etc.

```python filename="conditional.py" {2, 3, 4}
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
    print("Remember to carry your ID.")
```

If the indentation is inconsistent or missing, Python will raise an `IndentationError`.

### 3. Consistent Use of Spaces or Tabs

You must **choose either spaces or tabs** for indentation — do not mix them. PEP 8 (Python’s style guide) recommends:

- Using **4 spaces** per indentation level
- Avoiding tabs

Most modern IDEs and code editors are configured to use 4 spaces by default when writing Python code.

---

### 4. Nested Indentation

You can nest blocks inside other blocks, just like other languages. Each new block increases the indentation level.

```python filename="nested_if.py" {3, 4, 5, 6}
score = 85

if score >= 50:
    print("Pass")
    if score >= 80:
        print("Distinction")
```

In this example, the inner `if` block is indented further than the outer block, and Python uses this indentation to determine the scope of each condition.

---

### 5. Indentation Errors

Python is strict about indentation. A mismatch in indentation will immediately raise an error.

#### Example of Incorrect Indentation:

```python filename="error_example.py" {3}
def greet():
print("Hello")  # This will raise an IndentationError
```

Output:

```
IndentationError: expected an indented block
```

To fix it:

```python filename="corrected_greet.py" {2}
def greet():
    print("Hello")
```

---

### 6. Multiline Statements and Indentation

If a statement spans multiple lines, Python allows implicit continuation inside parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, or braces `{}`. You can also use the backslash `\` for explicit continuation (though it’s less preferred).

```python filename="multiline.py" {2, 3}
numbers = [
    1, 2, 3,
    4, 5, 6
]
```

---

### 7. Best Practices

- **Always use 4 spaces** for indentation (not tabs).
- Configure your editor to display invisible characters (to avoid mixing tabs/spaces).
- Keep your indentation consistent within the file.
- Avoid deeply nested blocks by using functions where appropriate.

### Conclusion

Python’s syntax emphasizes **readability and consistency**, and indentation is at the heart of its design philosophy. While it may feel strict at first, it promotes clean code and reduces visual clutter, especially in larger projects.
