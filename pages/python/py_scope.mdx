# Variable Scope in Python

**Scope** refers to the region of a program where a variable is **visible** and **accessible**.

In Python, variable scope is critical to writing **clear**, **bug-free**, and **maintainable** code.
You need to understand **where** your variables exist — and when they are created or destroyed.

## Types of Variable Scope

| Scope Type    | Where Defined                                    | Lifetime                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Local**     | Inside a function                                | Exists only during function execution   |
| **Global**    | Outside any function                             | Exists as long as program runs          |
| **Enclosing** | Inside enclosing function (for nested functions) | As long as enclosing function exists    |
| **Built-in**  | Defined by Python                                | Always available (e.g., `len`, `range`) |

## Local Scope Example

```python filename="scope_local.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
def my_func():
    x = 10  # Local variable
    print("Inside function, x =", x)

my_func()
# print(x)  # This would cause an error
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Inside function, x = 10
```

### Explanation:

- `x` is **local** to `my_func`.
- It cannot be accessed **outside** the function.

---

## Global Scope Example

```python filename="scope_global.py" {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
x = 50  # Global variable

def my_func():
    print("Inside function, x =", x)

my_func()
print("Outside function, x =", x)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Inside function, x = 50
Outside function, x = 50
```

### Explanation:

- `x` is declared **outside** the function — so it is **global**.
- It is accessible **inside** and **outside** the function.

---

## Modifying Global Variable Inside a Function

```python filename="scope_modify_global.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
x = 5

def change_global():
    global x
    x = 100

change_global()
print("x =", x)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
x = 100
```

### Explanation:

- `global` keyword tells Python that `x` inside the function refers to the **global** variable.

---

## Enclosing Scope (Nested Functions)

```python filename="scope_enclosing.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
def outer():
    x = "outer value"

    def inner():
        print("Inner:", x)

    inner()

outer()
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Inner: outer value
```

### Explanation:

- Inner function `inner()` can access variables from its **enclosing function** `outer()`.

---

## LEGB Rule

Python follows this order to resolve variable names:

**L → Local**
**E → Enclosing**
**G → Global**
**B → Built-in**

It checks each scope **in order** until it finds the variable.

---

## Built-in Scope Example

```python filename="scope_builtin.py" {2, 3, 4}
print(len("Hello"))  # Built-in len() function
```

```python filename="output.txt"
5
```

### Explanation:

- Functions like `len()`, `range()`, `print()` are defined in **built-in scope** — always available.

---

## Shadowing Variables

```python filename="scope_shadow.py" {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
x = 10

def my_func():
    x = 20  # Shadows global x
    print("x inside:", x)

my_func()
print("x outside:", x)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
x inside: 20
x outside: 10
```

### Explanation:

- Local variable `x` **shadows** the global variable inside the function.

## Best Practices for Scope

| Guideline                          | Why                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Use local variables when possible  | Avoid unintended side effects  |
| Limit use of global variables      | Keeps functions self-contained |
| Use clear variable names per scope | Improves readability           |
| Understand LEGB rule               | Prevents scope-related bugs    |

---

## Summary

- **Scope** defines where a variable exists in your program.
- Use `local` scope inside functions; limit global variables.
- Python resolves names using the **LEGB** rule.
- Nested functions can access enclosing variables.
- Built-in functions are always accessible.
