# Introduction to Exceptions in Python

An **exception** is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that **disrupts the normal flow** of instructions.

In Python:
Errors are represented as **exception objects**
If an exception occurs and is not handled, the program **terminates** with an error message
Python provides a powerful way to **handle exceptions** using `try`, `except` blocks

## Why Handle Exceptions?

| Reason                     | Benefit                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Graceful Error Handling    | Prevent crashes and unexpected termination |
| User-friendly Messages     | Display meaningful error messages          |
| Maintain Program Stability | Keep application running smoothly          |
| Handle Unexpected Inputs   | Manage edge cases without failure          |

## Common Exceptions in Python

| Exception Type      | Meaning                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `ZeroDivisionError` | Division by zero          |
| `TypeError`         | Invalid type operation    |
| `ValueError`        | Invalid value             |
| `IndexError`        | Index out of range        |
| `KeyError`          | Missing key in dictionary |
| `FileNotFoundError` | File not found            |

## Example 1: Unhandled Exception

```python filename="example1_unhandled.py" {2, 3}
a = 5 / 0
```

```python filename="output.txt"
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

**Explanation:**
Division by zero causes an exception and the program stops execution.

---

## Example 2: Basic Exception Handling

```python filename="example2_basic_handling.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")
```

```python filename="output.txt"
You cannot divide by zero!
```

**Explanation:**
The program does not crash — the exception is **handled**.

---

## Example 3: Handling Multiple Exceptions

```python filename="example3_multiple.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
try:
    num = int("abc")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid conversion!")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Division by zero!")
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Invalid conversion!
```

---

## Example 4: Catching All Exceptions (Not Recommended)

```python filename="example4_generic.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
try:
    x = undefined_variable
except Exception as e:
    print("Error occurred:", e)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Error occurred: name 'undefined_variable' is not defined
```

---

## How Exception Handling Works

```text
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except ExceptionType:
    # Code that runs if exception occurs
else:
    # Code that runs if no exception occurs
finally:
    # Code that always runs (cleanup)
```

---

## Key Points

Exceptions are runtime errors that can disrupt the program
`try`...`except` block is used to handle exceptions
Multiple exceptions can be handled
`finally` block always runs — used for cleanup (e.g., closing files)

---

## Summary

- Exceptions help manage **error-prone situations** gracefully
- Without handling, exceptions **terminate** the program
- Use `try`...`except`...`finally` for robust error handling
- Common exceptions: `ZeroDivisionError`, `ValueError`, `IndexError`, etc.

Next, we will cover **Try, Except, Else, Finally** in more detail — and see how you can structure robust error-handling logic in Python.
