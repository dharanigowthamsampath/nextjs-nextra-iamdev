# Try, Except, Else, Finally in Python

Python provides a **structured way** to handle exceptions using four keywords:

`try` — Code block where exceptions can occur
`except` — Code block to handle exceptions
`else` — Runs if no exception occurs
`finally` — Runs always (used for cleanup)

This helps you write **robust**, **error-tolerant** programs.

---

## Basic Syntax

```python filename="try_except_syntax.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except ExceptionType:
    # Code that runs if exception occurs
else:
    # Runs if no exception occurs
finally:
    # Always runs (cleanup)
```

---

## Example 1: Try-Except Block

```python filename="example1_try_except.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print("Result:", 10 / num)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Invalid input!")
```

```python filename="output.txt"
# If input = 0
Error: Division by zero!

# If input = abc
Error: Invalid input!
```

**Explanation:**
`try` block attempts to execute code.
If an exception occurs — corresponding `except` block handles it.

---

## Example 2: Try-Except with Generic Exception

```python filename="example2_try_except_generic.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
try:
    file = open("nonexistent.txt")
except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred:", e)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
An error occurred: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'nonexistent.txt'
```

---

## Example 3: Multiple Except Blocks

```python filename="example3_multiple_except.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
try:
    lst = [1, 2, 3]
    print(lst[5])
except IndexError:
    print("Index out of range!")
except Exception as e:
    print("Some other error:", e)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Index out of range!
```

---

## Example 4: Using Else Block

```python filename="example4_else.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
try:
    x = 5
    y = 2
    result = x / y
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
else:
    print("Result is:", result)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Result is: 2.5
```

**Explanation:**
`else` runs **only if no exception occurs**.

---

## Example 5: Try-Except-Else-Finally

```python filename="example5_full_structure.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
try:
    value = int("100")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid value.")
else:
    print("Conversion successful. Value =", value)
finally:
    print("Execution completed.")
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Conversion successful. Value = 100
Execution completed.
```

**Explanation:**
`finally` block **always runs** — even if an exception is raised.
Useful for **cleanup** — closing files, releasing resources, etc.

---

## Example 6: Using Finally for Cleanup

```python filename="example6_cleanup.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}
try:
    file = open("sample.txt", "w")
    file.write("Hello, Python!")
except IOError:
    print("I/O error occurred.")
else:
    print("File written successfully.")
finally:
    file.close()
    print("File closed.")
```

```python filename="output.txt"
File written successfully.
File closed.
```

---

## Key Points

`try`: Code that may raise an exception
`except`: Catches and handles exceptions
`else`: Runs if no exception occurred
`finally`: Always runs (useful for resource cleanup)

---

## Summary

- Python provides structured exception handling with `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`.
- Helps manage **runtime errors gracefully**.
- Allows performing **safe cleanup** of resources.
- Always close files or release resources inside `finally`.

Next, we will cover **Raising Exceptions** — how you can manually trigger exceptions in your code for better error handling.
