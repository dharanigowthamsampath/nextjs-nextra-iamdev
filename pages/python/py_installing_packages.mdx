# Installing Packages in Python

Beyond the **Standard Library** and your own modules, Python supports **external packages** — reusable code written by the community or third-party developers.

To manage external packages, Python uses:

`pip` — Python’s built-in **package installer**
[PyPI](https://pypi.org) — The **Python Package Index**, a large repository of open-source Python packages

---

## What Is `pip`?

- `pip` is the official package manager for Python.
- It allows you to **download, install, upgrade, and remove packages** from PyPI.
- You can use `pip` directly from the command line.

---

## Installing a Package

### Basic Syntax:

```bash
pip install package_name
```

---

## Example 1: Install `requests` Package

```bash
pip install requests
```

**Explanation:**

- Installs the popular `requests` library for working with HTTP.

---

## Example 2: Using Installed Package

```python filename="requests_example.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.github.com')
print("Status Code:", response.status_code)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Status Code: 200
```

---

## Checking Installed Packages

```bash
pip list
```

**Explanation:**

- Lists all installed packages and their versions.

---

## Upgrading a Package

```bash
pip install --upgrade package_name
```

Example:

```bash
pip install --upgrade requests
```

---

## Uninstalling a Package

```bash
pip uninstall package_name
```

Example:

```bash
pip uninstall requests
```

---

## Installing a Specific Version

```bash
pip install package_name==version_number
```

Example:

```bash
pip install Django==4.2.0
```

---

## Using a `requirements.txt` File

In larger projects, you often maintain a list of required packages:

File: `requirements.txt`

```
requests==2.31.0
Django>=4.2
pandas
```

### Install all at once:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Virtual Environments

For managing project-specific dependencies, it’s best to use a **virtual environment**:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

Then:

```bash
pip install package_name
```

---

## Summary

- Use `pip` to install external packages from PyPI.
- Installed packages can be used via `import`.
- You can install, upgrade, or uninstall packages easily.
- Manage dependencies cleanly with **virtual environments** and `requirements.txt`.
