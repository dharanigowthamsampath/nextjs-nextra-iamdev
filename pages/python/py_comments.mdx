# Comments in Python

Comments are an essential part of writing **clean, maintainable, and professional code**. While your code tells the computer what to do, comments explain your intentions to other developers ‚Äî including your future self.

In Python, comments are easy to write and highly encouraged. They are **ignored by the Python interpreter** and serve purely as human-readable documentation.

This section explores the different types of comments in Python, when and how to use them, and what makes a comment truly useful.

---

### 1. What is a Comment?

A **comment** is a line or part of a line in a program that is not executed. It helps:

- Explain the logic or intent behind code
- Clarify complex operations
- Provide metadata (e.g., author, date, purpose)
- Temporarily disable code during debugging

---

### 2. Single-Line Comments

In Python, single-line comments begin with a **hash symbol (`#`)**. Everything after the `#` on that line is treated as a comment.

```python filename="single_line.py" {1, 2} copy
# This is a single-line comment
name = "Alice"  # This comment is after a line of code
print("Hello,", name)
```

> üí° **Tip:** Avoid stating the obvious. A good comment explains **why**, not just **what**.

**Bad comment:**

```python
i = i + 1  # Increment i by 1
```

**Better comment:**

```python
i = i + 1  # Move to the next item in the list
```

---

### 3. Multi-Line Comments

Python does **not** have a distinct multi-line comment syntax like `/* */` in some other languages. Instead, you use `#` at the beginning of each line:

```python filename="multi_line.py" {1, 2, 3}
# This function calculates the area of a circle.
# It takes the radius as input and returns the result.
# The formula used is: area = œÄ * r^2
def area(radius):
    return 3.14 * radius * radius
```

For longer explanations or module-level comments, it‚Äôs better to use **docstrings** (discussed below).

---

### 4. Docstrings (Documentation Strings)

A **docstring** is a special kind of multi-line string used to document a module, class, method, or function. Unlike regular comments, **docstrings are accessible at runtime** via the `.__doc__` attribute.

They are written using **triple quotes** (`""" """` or `''' '''`) and placed **immediately after** the definition of a function, class, or module.

```python filename="docstring_example.py" {1, 2, 3, 4}
def greet(name):
    """
    Greets the person by name.
    :param name: str - The name of the person
    :return: None
    """
    print("Hello,", name)
```

You can access this docstring in Python:

```python filename="access_docstring.py" {3}
print(greet.__doc__)
```

### 5. Where to Use Comments

| Use Case               | Example                                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Explaining logic       | Why you chose a particular algorithm or technique              |
| Marking TODOs          | `# TODO: Optimize this loop later`                             |
| Clarifying workarounds | When a bug or platform limitation requires an unusual solution |
| Separating sections    | `# ----- Input Handling -----`                                 |

### 6. Best Practices

#### ‚úÖ Do:

- Keep comments **concise but informative**
- Update comments when code changes
- Use them to explain **why**, not just **what**

#### ‚ùå Avoid:

- Redundant or obvious comments
- Leaving outdated or misleading comments
- Writing overly long paragraphs ‚Äî split into logical blocks

---

### 7. Special Comment Tags

You‚Äôll often find commonly accepted tags in team projects:

```python filename="todo_fixme.py" {1, 2}
# TODO: Add error handling for edge cases
# FIXME: This crashes if the file is not found
```

These are **not official Python syntax**, but many IDEs recognize them and offer navigation shortcuts.

---

### 8. Commenting Out Code

During development or debugging, you might temporarily disable a line or block of code using comments:

```python filename="commenting_out.py" {2}
# print("Debug:", user_input)
```

However, large-scale disabling should be done using version control (e.g., Git) or conditional flags ‚Äî not by leaving commented-out code in production.

---

### Conclusion

Comments are powerful tools when used wisely. They should complement your code, not clutter it. Always aim to write code that is **self-explanatory**, and use comments to **fill in the why**, not the what. Clean code with meaningful comments is one of the hallmarks of a professional Python developer.
