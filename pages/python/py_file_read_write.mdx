# Reading and Writing Files in Python

One of the most essential features in Python is **file handling**. It allows you to:

Read data from files
Write data to files
Process external data (logs, configs, CSV, JSON, etc.)
Store output for later use

Python provides a simple and intuitive way to handle files using built-in functions.

---

## Basic Workflow

1. Open the file using `open()`
2. Perform read or write operation
3. Close the file (automatically using `with`)

---

## Opening Files

```python filename="file_open_basic.py" {2, 3}
file = open("example.txt", "r")  # Open for reading
file.close()
```

---

## Reading from a File

### `read()` â€” Read Entire File

```python filename="file_read_entire.py" {2, 3, 4}
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

**Explanation:**
`read()` reads the entire file as a string.

---

### `readline()` â€” Read One Line at a Time

```python filename="file_readline.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    line1 = file.readline()
    line2 = file.readline()
    print(line1.strip())
    print(line2.strip())
```

**Explanation:**
`readline()` reads **one line** each time it is called.

---

### Iterating Line by Line

```python filename="file_iterate.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())
```

**Explanation:**
Looping over the file gives you each line.

---

## Writing to a File

### `write()` â€” Write Strings to File

```python filename="file_write.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!\n")
    file.write("This is written to the file.\n")
```

**Explanation:**
`'w'` mode overwrites the file or creates it if it doesnâ€™t exist.

---

## Appending to a File

### `a` Mode â€” Append New Content

```python filename="file_append.py" {2, 3, 4}
with open("output.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("Appending this line.\n")
```

**Explanation:**
`'a'` mode **preserves existing content** and adds new data at the end.

---

## Closing Files

When using:

```python filename="file_close.py" {2, 3}
file = open("example.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
file.close()
```

ðŸ‘‰ You must call `file.close()` yourself â€” otherwise, resources might stay open.

---

## Using `with` Statement

```python filename="file_with.py" {2, 3, 4}
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

**Benefits:**
File is **automatically closed**
Prevents resource leaks
Recommended practice!

---

## Summary

Python supports powerful, simple **file I/O**:

- `read()`, `readline()`, iteration â€” for reading
- `write()`, `append()` â€” for writing
  Always use `with open()` â€” best practice
  Handling files is key for most **real-world applications**

---

Next, we will cover **File Modes** â€” understanding the different ways to open files (`'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`, `'b'`, `'x'`, etc.).
