# Conditional Statements in Python

In any programming language, **decision-making** is key. Python provides conditional statements to let you run code based on conditions.

These are essential when you want your program to **respond differently depending on user input, state, or data**.

## Types of Conditional Statements in Python

1. `if` statement
2. `if-else` statement
3. `if-elif-else` ladder
4. Nested `if` statements

---

## Basic Syntax of `if` Statement

```python filename="if_syntax.py" {2, 3, 4}
if condition:
    # block of code
```

### Explanation:

- The `condition` is an expression that evaluates to **True** or **False**.
- If **True**, the indented block of code runs.
- If **False**, Python skips the block.

---

## Example 1: Simple `if` Statement

```python filename="if_example.py" {2, 3, 4}
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
```

```python filename="output.txt"
You are eligible to vote.
```

---

## Example 2: `if-else` Statement

```python filename="if_else_example.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
age = 16
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
```

```python filename="output.txt"
You are not eligible to vote.
```

### Explanation:

- The `else` block runs if the `if` condition is False.
- This provides a clear **alternative action**.

---

## Example 3: `if-elif-else` Ladder

```python filename="if_elif_else_example.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
marks = 85

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif marks >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Grade: B
```

### Explanation:

- The `elif` (short for **else if**) allows multiple conditions to be checked.
- The first **True** condition will run.
- If no condition is True, `else` block executes.

---

## Example 4: Nested `if` Statements

```python filename="nested_if_example.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
num = 10

if num > 0:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("Positive Even number")
    else:
        print("Positive Odd number")
else:
    print("Negative number")
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Positive Even number
```

### Explanation:

- You can **nest** one `if` block inside another for complex logic.
- Be careful with indentation to maintain readability.

---

## Example 5: Using Logical Operators in Conditions

```python filename="logical_condition_example.py" {2, 3, 4, 5}
age = 25
citizen = True

if age >= 18 and citizen:
    print("Eligible to vote")
else:
    print("Not eligible")
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Eligible to vote
```

### Explanation:

- You can combine multiple conditions using `and`, `or`, `not`.
- This enables **compound conditions**.

---

## Summary

- Conditional statements are used to perform **different actions based on conditions**.
- `if`, `if-else`, `if-elif-else`, and **nested if** help control the flow of your program.
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) can be used to build complex conditions.
- **Indentation** is crucial in Python — it defines code blocks.
