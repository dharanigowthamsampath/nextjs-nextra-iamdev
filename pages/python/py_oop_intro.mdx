# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" — data structures that contain **data** (attributes) and **functions** (methods) to operate on that data.

Python supports OOP and allows you to design code that is **modular**, **reusable**, and **easier to maintain**.

## Key Concepts of OOP

| Concept       | Meaning                                                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Class         | A blueprint for creating objects                                              |
| Object        | An instance of a class                                                        |
| Attribute     | Data stored in an object                                                      |
| Method        | Function defined inside a class                                               |
| Encapsulation | Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction through methods           |
| Inheritance   | One class can inherit attributes and behavior from another class              |
| Polymorphism  | Objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass |

## Why Use OOP?

| Benefit            | Description                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Modular Code       | Divide code into logical parts                        |
| Reusability        | Define classes once, reuse multiple times             |
| Easier Maintenance | Change in one place affects all objects of that class |
| Scalability        | More natural for complex software design              |

## How OOP Works in Python

- You define a **class** using the `class` keyword.
- You create **objects** (instances) from the class.
- You can add **attributes** and **methods** to represent object state and behavior.

## Example 1: Basic Class Definition

```python filename="oop_intro_class.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
class Person:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello!")

p = Person()
p.greet()
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Hello!
```

---

## Example 2: Class with Attributes and Methods

```python filename="oop_intro_attributes.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def introduce(self):
        print(f"My name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

p1 = Person("Alice", 30)
p1.introduce()
```

```python filename="output.txt"
My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
```

---

## Example 3: Multiple Objects from the Same Class

```python filename="oop_intro_multiple_objects.py" {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
class Car:
    def __init__(self, model, year):
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Model: {self.model}, Year: {self.year}")

car1 = Car("Tesla Model S", 2022)
car2 = Car("Ford Mustang", 2020)

car1.display_info()
car2.display_info()
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Model: Tesla Model S, Year: 2022
Model: Ford Mustang, Year: 2020
```

## How Does OOP Improve Code Quality?

| Advantage                            | Example                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Logical grouping of data + behavior  | Class `Car` has both `model` and `display_info()` |
| No need for global variables         | Each object stores its own state                  |
| Reduced code duplication             | Methods shared across all objects of a class      |
| Easier to understand large codebases | Each class serves one responsibility              |

## Summary

- OOP allows you to build software using **objects**.
- An object is an instance of a **class**.
- Objects contain **attributes** (data) and **methods** (behavior).
- OOP makes Python programs **modular**, **reusable**, and **scalable**.
