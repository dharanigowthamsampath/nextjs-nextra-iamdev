# Tuples in Python

A **tuple** in Python is a **collection of ordered and immutable elements**. Tuples are similar to lists but cannot be changed after creation. Because of their immutability, tuples are faster and used when the data should remain constant throughout the program.

## Key Characteristics of Tuples

- **Ordered**: The elements have a defined order.
- **Immutable**: Once created, you cannot change, add, or remove elements.
- **Heterogeneous**: Can store elements of different data types.
- **Indexable**: Supports indexing and slicing like lists.
- **Hashable**: Tuples can be used as dictionary keys (if all elements are hashable).

## Creating Tuples

```python filename="tuple_create.py" {1, 2, 3}
empty_tuple = ()
single_element = (10,)   # Must include a comma
mixed_tuple = (1, "hello", 3.5)
```

### Explanation:

- Parentheses `()` define a tuple.
- A single-element tuple must have a trailing comma (e.g., `(10,)`), otherwise Python treats it as just a value in parentheses.

---

## Example 1: Indexing and Accessing Elements

```python filename="tuple_index.py" {2, 3, 4}
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
print(colors[0])
print(colors[-1])
```

```python filename="output.txt"
red
blue
```

### Explanation:

- Indexing starts at `0`.
- Negative indices access elements from the end.

## Example 2: Tuple Unpacking

```python filename="tuple_unpacking.py" {2, 3}
coordinates = (4, 5)
x, y = coordinates
print("X:", x, "Y:", y)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
X: 4 Y: 5
```

### Explanation:

- Tuple unpacking allows assigning elements of a tuple to multiple variables in one line.
- The number of variables must match the number of elements in the tuple.

---

## Example 3: Immutability of Tuples

```python filename="tuple_immutable.py" {2}
t = (1, 2, 3)
t[0] = 10  # This will raise an error
```

```python filename="output.txt"
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

### Explanation:

- Tuples cannot be modified after creation.
- This property makes them suitable for read-only or fixed data.

---

## Example 4: Iterating Through Tuples

```python filename="tuple_loop.py" {2, 3}
languages = ("Python", "Java", "C++")
for lang in languages:
    print(lang)
```

```python filename="output.txt"
Python
Java
C++
```

### Explanation:

- Like lists, tuples support iteration using `for` loops.

---

## Example 5: Tuple Methods – `count()` and `index()`

```python filename="tuple_methods.py" {2, 3}
nums = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2)
print(nums.count(2))   # Count occurrences
print(nums.index(3))   # Index of value
```

```python filename="output.txt"
3
3
```

### Explanation:

- `count(value)` returns the number of times the value appears.
- `index(value)` returns the first index where the value occurs.

---

## Example 6: Nested Tuples

```python filename="tuple_nested.py" {2, 3}
info = ("John", (25, "Developer"))
print(info[1][0])  # Accessing inner tuple
```

```python filename="output.txt"
25
```

### Explanation:

- Tuples can contain other tuples (or other collections).
- Indexing works recursively for nested structures.

## When to Use Tuples Over Lists

| Criteria              | Use Tuple                    | Use List           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Mutability            | Data should not change       | Data may change    |
| Performance           | Faster (memory efficient)    | Slightly slower    |
| Use as Dictionary Key | Yes (if hashable)            | No                 |
| Semantic Meaning      | Fixed group of related items | Dynamic collection |

---

## Summary

- Tuples are ordered, immutable sequences.
- They are defined with parentheses and support indexing, slicing, and unpacking.
- They are useful when the data should not be modified, improving code safety and performance.
- Tuples can be nested and used as keys in dictionaries.

In the next topic, we’ll explore **Sets** — another core collection type, useful for storing **unique elements** and performing **set operations**.
