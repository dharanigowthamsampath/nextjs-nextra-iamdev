# Logical NOT (`!`) Operator in C++

The **Logical NOT** operator in C++ is a **unary operator** (operates on one operand) that **reverses the boolean value** of an expression.

- If the condition is `true`, `!` makes it `false`.
- If the condition is `false`, `!` makes it `true`.

This operator is commonly used to **negate conditions** and write more concise control structures.

## Syntax

```cpp
!condition
```

---

## Truth Table

| Condition | `!Condition` |
| --------- | ------------ |
| false     | true         |
| true      | false        |

---

## Example 1: Basic Usage

```cpp filename="not_basic.cpp" copy {3}
bool isAvailable = true;
std::cout << !isAvailable;  // Output: 0
```

**Explanation:**

- `isAvailable` is `true`
- `!isAvailable` becomes `false` → `0` is printed

---

## Example 2: Negating a Comparison

```cpp filename="not_comparison.cpp" copy {3}
int age = 15;
std::cout << !(age >= 18);  // Output: 1
```

**Explanation:**

- `age >= 18` → false
- `!false` → true → Output: `1`

---

## Example 3: In an If Statement

```cpp filename="not_if.cpp" copy {3, 4}
bool isLoggedIn = false;

if (!isLoggedIn) {
    std::cout << "Please log in first.";
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Since `isLoggedIn` is false, `!isLoggedIn` becomes true → message is shown

---

## Example 4: With Integers

In C++, integer values can be used in logical expressions:

- `0` is treated as `false`
- Any non-zero value is `true`

```cpp filename="not_integer.cpp" copy {3}
int x = 0;
std::cout << !x;  // Output: 1
```

**Explanation:**

- `x` is 0 (false), so `!x` becomes true → Output: `1`

---

## Example 5: With Characters

```cpp filename="not_char.cpp" copy {3}
char c = 'A';
std::cout << !c;  // Output: 0
```

**Explanation:**

- `'A'` has an ASCII value of 65 (non-zero, true)
- `!c` → false → Output: `0`

---

## Example 6: Complex Condition

```cpp filename="not_complex.cpp" copy {3}
int score = 90;
std::cout << !(score < 40 || score > 100);  // Output: 1
```

**Explanation:**

- `score < 40 || score > 100` → false
- `!false` → true → Output: `1`

---

## Example 7: Not in Loops

```cpp filename="not_loop.cpp" copy {4, 5}
bool isDone = false;

while (!isDone) {
    std::cout << "Processing...\n";
    isDone = true;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The loop runs once because `!isDone` is initially `true`

---

## Summary

- The `!` operator is used to **reverse** a Boolean value.
- It’s most useful in `if`, `while`, and conditional expressions.
- Can be used on `bool`, integers, characters, and expressions that evaluate to Boolean logic.
- Keep your expressions **readable** when using `!` with complex conditions.

## Practice Exercises

1. Write a program to print **“Access Denied”** if a user is **not authenticated** (`isAuthenticated = false`).
2. Create a program that prints “Outside range” if a number is **not** between 10 and 20.
3. Use the `!` operator in a `while` loop to keep prompting the user until a condition becomes true.
