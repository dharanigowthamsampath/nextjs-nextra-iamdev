# Logical AND (`&&`) Operator in C++

In C++, the **Logical AND** operator (`&&`) is used to combine two or more conditions. It is commonly used in decision-making statements such as `if`, `while`, and `for` to determine whether **multiple conditions are true**.

---

## How the Logical AND Works

The syntax is:

```cpp
condition1 && condition2
```

This expression evaluates to:

- `true` **only if both** `condition1` and `condition2` are true.
- `false` **if at least one** of the conditions is false.

### Truth Table

| `condition1` | `condition2` | Result (`condition1 && condition2`) |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| true         | true         | true                                |
| true         | false        | false                               |
| false        | true         | false                               |
| false        | false        | false                               |

## Short-Circuit Behavior

C++ evaluates logical expressions **from left to right**.

In `A && B`:

- If `A` is false, **`B` is not evaluated**. This is known as **short-circuiting**, and it's an important performance feature and safety mechanism (e.g., preventing division by zero or null dereferencing).

---

## Example 1: Basic Integer Conditions

```cpp filename="and_basic_integers.cpp" copy {3}
int a = 10, b = 20;
std::cout << (a > 5 && b > 15);
```

### Explanation

- `a > 5` → true (10 is greater than 5)
- `b > 15` → true (20 is greater than 15)
- `true && true` → **true**

Output: `1` (since `true` is internally represented as `1`)

---

## Example 2: One Condition Fails

```cpp filename="and_one_false.cpp" copy {3}
int x = 10, y = 5;
std::cout << (x > 15 && y < 10);
```

### Explanation

- `x > 15` → false (10 is not greater than 15)
- `y < 10` → true
- `false && true` → **false**

Output: `0`

---

## Example 3: Using in an `if` Statement

```cpp filename="and_if_statement.cpp" copy {4, 5}
int age = 22;
int marks = 80;

if (age >= 18 && marks >= 60) {
    std::cout << "Eligible for scholarship";
}
```

### Explanation

- `age >= 18` → true
- `marks >= 60` → true
- Since both conditions are true, the message is printed.

---

## Example 4: Short-Circuit Prevention

```cpp filename="and_short_circuit.cpp" copy {4, 5}
int a = 0, b = 100;

if (a != 0 && (b / a) > 1) {
    std::cout << "Safe to divide";
}
```

### Explanation

- `a != 0` → false
- Because the first condition is false, the second `(b / a)` is **not evaluated**, preventing a division-by-zero error.

---

## Example 5: With Booleans

```cpp filename="and_booleans.cpp" copy {3}
bool a = true;
bool b = false;

std::cout << (a && b);  // Output: 0
```

### Explanation

- `true && false` → false
- Output: `0`

---

## Example 6: With Characters

```cpp filename="and_characters.cpp" copy {3}
char grade = 'A';

std::cout << (grade == 'A' && grade != 'F');  // Output: 1
```

### Explanation

- `grade == 'A'` → true
- `grade != 'F'` → true
- `true && true` → true → Output: `1`

---

## Example 7: With Strings

```cpp filename="and_strings.cpp" copy {4}
std::string username = "admin";
std::string password = "1234";

if (username == "admin" && password == "1234") {
    std::cout << "Access Granted";
}
```

### Explanation

- Both string comparisons return `true`
- Since both are true, the message is printed

---

## Example 8: Practical Range Check

```cpp filename="and_range_check.cpp" copy {3}
int marks = 75;
std::cout << (marks >= 0 && marks <= 100);
```

### Explanation

- `marks >= 0` → true
- `marks <= 100` → true
- Combined: `true && true` → `1`

---

## Example 9: Logical AND in Loops

```cpp filename="and_loop_example.cpp" copy {3, 4}
int i = 0;
while (i < 10 && i >= 0) {
    std::cout << i << " ";
    i++;
}
```

### Explanation

- The loop runs while `i` is less than 10 **and** greater than or equal to 0.
- Both conditions must hold true for each iteration.

Output: `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`

---

## Key Takeaways

- The `&&` operator is used when **all conditions** must be true.
- Evaluation stops early if the first condition is false (**short-circuiting**).
- It helps **write safe and readable conditional logic** in `if`, `while`, and other control structures.
- Works with all types that evaluate to Boolean values, including integers, characters, and strings.
