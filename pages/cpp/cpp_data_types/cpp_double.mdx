# The `double` Data Type in C++

In C++, the `double` data type is used to store floating-point numbers with double precision. It is particularly suited for situations where greater accuracy is needed in numerical calculations compared to the `float` type.

---

## What is `double`?

The keyword `double` stands for **"double-precision floating-point number"**. It allows storage of numbers with fractional parts and a higher level of precision. This is important in mathematical, scientific, and financial computations where accurate decimal values are critical.

Compared to `float`, a `double`:

- Consumes more memory (typically 8 bytes)
- Offers higher precision (about 15 to 17 digits)
- Handles a much larger range of values

## Declaring and Using `double`

The syntax for declaring a `double` is straightforward. You simply use the `double` keyword followed by the variable name and an optional initial value.

```cpp filename="double_declaration.cpp" copy {3, 4}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    double pi = 3.1415926535;
    std::cout << "Value of pi: " << pi << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In the example above:

- The variable `pi` is declared as a `double` and initialized with a precise value of π.
- `std::cout` displays the value, preserving more decimal places than a `float`.

---

## Precision and Use Case Comparison

To understand the difference between `float` and `double`, consider the following:

```cpp filename="float_vs_double.cpp" copy {4, 5}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    float f = 3.1415926535;
    double d = 3.1415926535;

    std::cout << "Float: " << f << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Double: " << d << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

The `float` output will likely be truncated, while `double` will retain more digits. This demonstrates that `double` is preferable when precision matters, such as in:

- Physics simulations
- Financial transactions
- Statistical computations

## Arithmetic with `double`

`double` supports all basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

```cpp filename="double_arithmetic.cpp" copy {4, 5}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    double x = 10.75;
    double y = 3.25;

    std::cout << "Sum: " << (x + y) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Product: " << (x * y) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This produces accurate results with fractional values that would otherwise be rounded or imprecise with `float`.

---

## Mixing `int` and `double`

When you mix `int` and `double` in an expression, C++ automatically promotes the `int` to a `double` to avoid losing precision.

```cpp filename="mixed_types.cpp" copy {4, 5}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a = 7;
    double b = 2.0;

    double result = a / b;
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this case, `7 / 2.0` evaluates to `3.5`, not `3`, because `b` is a `double`.

---

## Memory and Range

The typical memory size and range of a `double` are:

| Property        | Description                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Size            | 8 bytes (64 bits)                                      |
| Precision       | Approximately 15–17 decimal digits                     |
| Range           | ±1.7 × 10^308                                          |
| Default literal | A literal like `2.5` is treated as `double` by default |

For even higher precision, C++ provides `long double`, but `double` is sufficient for most high-accuracy tasks.

## Practice Problem 1: Area of a Circle

Write a program that calculates the area of a circle using a `double` for both the radius and π.

```cpp filename="area_circle.cpp" copy {5, 6}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    double radius = 4.2;
    double area = 3.1415926535 * radius * radius;
    std::cout << "Area: " << area << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Practice Problem 2: Compound Interest Calculator

Create a program that calculates compound interest using the formula:
**A = P × (1 + r)^t**,
where:

- `P` = principal amount
- `r` = annual interest rate
- `t` = time in years

```cpp filename="compound_interest.cpp" copy {6, 7, 8}
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    double principal = 5000;
    double rate = 0.06;
    double time = 4;

    double amount = principal * pow((1 + rate), time);
    std::cout << "Final amount: " << amount << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Practice Problem 3: Temperature Conversion

Convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula:
**F = (C × 9 / 5) + 32**

```cpp filename="temp_conversion.cpp" copy {5, 6}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    double celsius = 36.6;
    double fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;
    std::cout << "Fahrenheit: " << fahrenheit << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
