# Basic Assignment Operator (`=`) in C++

The **assignment operator (`=`)** in C++ is one of the most fundamental operators. It is used to assign the **value of the right-hand side expression to the left-hand side variable**.

---

## Purpose

- **Stores a value** in a variable.
- Can be used with **literals, variables, or expressions**.
- Enables **initialization** and **value updates** throughout the program.

---

## Syntax

```cpp
variable = value;
```

- `variable`: A declared identifier (must be declared before assignment).
- `value`: A literal, expression, or another variable.

---

## Example 1: Basic Integer Assignment

```cpp filename="assignment_int.cpp" copy {2}
int a;
a = 5;
std::cout << a;  // Output: 5
```

**Explanation:**

- Variable `a` is assigned the value `5` using `=`.
- That value is stored and printed.

---

## Example 2: Initialization at Declaration

```cpp filename="assignment_declaration.cpp" copy {1}
int age = 21;
```

**Explanation:**

- This is known as **inline initialization**—declaring and assigning in a single step.

---

## Example 3: Using Expressions

```cpp filename="assignment_expression.cpp" copy {3}
int x = 10;
int y = 5;
int result = x + y;  // result = 15
```

**Explanation:**

- The result of `x + y` is evaluated to `15` and assigned to `result`.

---

## Example 4: Assignment with Different Data Types

### Float Assignment

```cpp filename="assignment_float.cpp" copy {2}
float pi = 3.14f;
```

### Character Assignment

```cpp filename="assignment_char.cpp" copy {2}
char letter = 'C';
```

### Boolean Assignment

```cpp filename="assignment_bool.cpp" copy {2}
bool isOnline = true;
```

---

## Example 5: Updating a Variable

```cpp filename="assignment_update.cpp" copy {2, 3}
int count = 1;
count = count + 1;
std::cout << count;  // Output: 2
```

**Explanation:**

- `count + 1` is evaluated first → 2 is assigned to `count`.

---

## Example 6: Chain Assignment

```cpp filename="assignment_chain.cpp" copy {2}
int x, y, z;
x = y = z = 100;
```

**Explanation:**

- Values are assigned **right-to-left**.
- First, `z = 100`, then `y = z`, and finally `x = y`.

---

## Important Notes

- The assignment operator `=` is **not a comparison**.

  - `x = 5` assigns.
  - `x == 5` checks equality.

---

## Practice Exercises

1. Declare a variable `radius` and assign it `7.5`.
2. Assign a character `'A'` to a variable and print it.
3. Assign the sum of two integers into a third variable.
4. Use chain assignment to assign `50` to `a`, `b`, and `c`.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake         | Explanation                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `int x; x + 5;` | The result is unused; assignment is missing. |
| `x == 10;`      | This checks equality instead of assigning.   |

---

## Summary

- The `=` operator assigns the right-hand value to the left-hand variable.
- Supports all primitive types (`int`, `float`, `char`, `bool`, etc.).
- Enables chaining and inline initialization.
- Critical for program logic, variable updates, and calculations.
