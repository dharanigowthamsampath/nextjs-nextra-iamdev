# Variables in C++

In C++, **variables** are used to **store data** that your program can manipulate. They act as **named containers** that hold values which may change (or not) during program execution. Understanding variables is fundamental to learning any programming language.

---

## What is a Variable?

A **variable** is a **named memory location** used to store a value of a specific data type. You can think of it as a labeled box where you can put and retrieve values.

### Syntax:

```cpp filename="variable_syntax.cpp" copy {3, 4}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    std::cout << "Age: " << age << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- `int` is the **data type**
- `age` is the **variable name**
- `25` is the **value assigned**

---

## Declaring Variables

You declare a variable using the following format:

```cpp
<data_type> <variable_name> = <initial_value>;
```

Examples:

```cpp filename="variable_examples.cpp" copy {3, 4, 5}
#include <iostream>

int marks = 90;
float temperature = 36.6;
char grade = 'A';
```

---

## Rules for Naming Variables

Understanding naming rules ensures your code is both **valid** and **readable**.

✅ **Allowed:**

- Letters (a–z, A–Z)
- Digits (0–9), but not as the first character
- Underscore (`_`)

❌ **Not Allowed:**

- Spaces
- Special characters (`@`, `#`, `$`, etc.)
- Starting with a digit

---

### Best Practices

| Rule                                        | Example                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Start with a letter                         | `score`, `height`         |
| Use descriptive names                       | `totalMarks`, `age`       |
| Avoid reserved keywords                     | `int`, `return` ❌        |
| Use camelCase or snake_case for readability | `userName` or `user_name` |

---

## Variable Declaration Without Initialization

You can also declare a variable without assigning a value initially:

```cpp filename="variable_declare_only.cpp" copy {4, 5}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int count; // declared, not initialized
    count = 10; // value assigned later
    std::cout << count << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

> Note: Using an uninitialized variable without assigning a value leads to **undefined behavior**.

---

## Multiple Declarations in One Line

You can declare multiple variables of the same type in a single line:

```cpp filename="multi_variable.cpp" copy {4}
int x = 5, y = 10, z = 15;
```

---

## Constants vs Variables

A **variable** can change during execution. A **constant** cannot.

```cpp filename="constant_variable.cpp" copy {4, 5}
const int maxScore = 100;  // value cannot be changed
int score = 90;            // value can change
```

---

## Practice: Yes or No?

Let's reinforce the rules with a few **yes/no** questions.

> **Q1.** Can a variable name start with a number?
> ❌ **No**

> **Q2.** Is `float` a valid variable name?
> ❌ **No** – it's a reserved keyword

> **Q3.** Can you declare a variable without initializing it?
> ✅ **Yes**

> **Q4.** Can a variable name contain an underscore (`_`)?
> ✅ **Yes**

> **Q5.** Is `int 5age = 30;` valid?
> ❌ **No** – variable name cannot start with a digit

## Practice Code: Area of a Circle

```cpp filename="circle_area.cpp" copy {5, 6, 7}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    float radius = 4.5;
    float area = 3.14 * radius * radius;
    std::cout << "Area: " << area << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Practice Code: Swapping Two Numbers

```cpp filename="swap_numbers.cpp" copy {6, 7, 8}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 10;
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
    std::cout << "a: " << a << ", b: " << b << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Summary

| Concept                   | Description                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Variable                  | Named container to hold a value                  |
| Declaration               | `type name;` or `type name = value;`             |
| Initialization (optional) | Assign a value at the time of declaration        |
| Naming rules              | Start with a letter or `_`, no symbols or spaces |
| Multiple declaration      | Allowed if of the same type                      |
| Constants (`const`)       | Used when values must not change                 |

Variables are the **foundation** of all logical operations in C++. Mastering them will enable you to manage memory, perform calculations, and build interactive programs effectively.
