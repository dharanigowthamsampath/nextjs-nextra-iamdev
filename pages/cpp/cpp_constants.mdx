# Constants in C++

In C++, **constants** are variables whose values **cannot be changed** after they are defined. They are useful when you want to ensure that specific values remain fixed throughout the execution of a program — such as mathematical constants, configuration values, or settings that should not be altered accidentally.

Using constants makes your code **more readable**, **more maintainable**, and **less error-prone**.

## What is a Constant?

A constant is a value that, once assigned, **cannot be modified**. It is declared using the `const` keyword.

### Syntax:

```cpp
const <data_type> <constant_name> = <value>;
```

---

## Example: Declaring a Constant

```cpp filename="constant_example.cpp" copy {4, 5}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    const float PI = 3.14159;
    std::cout << "Value of PI: " << PI << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- `const` makes the variable `PI` constant
- The value `3.14159` cannot be changed once assigned

---

## Attempting to Modify a Constant

Trying to change the value of a constant will result in a **compilation error**.

```cpp filename="modify_constant.cpp" copy {6}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    const int MAX = 100;
    MAX = 200; // Error: cannot assign to a variable declared 'const'
    return 0;
}
```

## Why Use Constants?

| Reason                     | Description                                                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prevent accidental changes | Ensures critical values stay unchanged                                     |
| Improve readability        | Makes your code easier to understand and maintain                          |
| Self-documenting           | Names like `MAX_USERS` or `PI` are clearer than using raw numbers directly |
| Help with debugging        | Reduces the risk of silent logical errors                                  |

## Types of Constants in C++

### 1. **Literal Constants**

Direct values used in code (e.g., `10`, `'A'`, `3.14`) — these are implicit constants.

### 2. **`const` Variables**

Declared using the `const` keyword.

```cpp filename="const_variable.cpp" copy {4}
const int MIN_AGE = 18;
```

### 3. **`#define` Macros (Preprocessor Constants)**

Another way to define constants, mostly used in C and old-style C++.

```cpp filename="define_macro.cpp" copy {2}
#define PI 3.14159
```

> Use `const` instead of `#define` in modern C++ for type safety and better scoping.

---

## Constant Expressions (`constexpr`)

Introduced in C++11, `constexpr` defines values evaluated at **compile-time** instead of run-time.

```cpp filename="constexpr_example.cpp" copy {4}
constexpr int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}
```

Use `constexpr` when you need the value during compilation, such as defining array sizes.

---

## Constants with Different Data Types

```cpp filename="const_types.cpp" copy {4, 5, 6}
const int MAX_SCORE = 100;
const char GRADE = 'A';
const float TEMPERATURE = 36.5;
const bool IS_ACTIVE = true;
```

---

## Practice: Area of a Circle with `const`

```cpp filename="circle_area_const.cpp" copy {5, 6, 7}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    const float PI = 3.14;
    float radius = 7.0;
    float area = PI * radius * radius;
    std::cout << "Area: " << area << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Practice: Yes or No?

> **Q1.** Can a constant value be modified later in the program?
> **No**

> **Q2.** Is `#define` type-safe like `const`?
> **No**

> **Q3.** Can constants be used in expressions?
> **Yes**

> **Q4.** Does `const` require initialization during declaration?
> **Yes**

> **Q5.** Is `constexpr` evaluated at compile time?
> **Yes**

## Summary

| Feature         | Description                                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `const`         | Declares a variable as constant                          |
| `#define`       | Preprocessor constant (avoid in modern C++)              |
| `constexpr`     | Compile-time constant (C++11 and newer)                  |
| Must initialize | `const` variables must be assigned at declaration        |
| Cannot modify   | Attempting to change a constant results in compile error |
| Improves safety | Prevents unintentional value changes                     |

### Tip for Beginners

Use `const` whenever you want to make your intent **explicit** and **protect values** from being modified. It’s a simple but powerful tool for writing reliable code.
