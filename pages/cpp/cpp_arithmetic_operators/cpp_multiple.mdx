# Multiplication Operator in C++

The **multiplication operator (`*`)** in C++ is used to calculate the product of two operands. It works with numeric data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, and even with characters (interpreted via their ASCII values). Mastering how multiplication behaves with different data types is essential for writing accurate arithmetic expressions and algorithms.

---

## Syntax

```cpp
result = operand1 * operand2;
```

- `operand1` and `operand2` can be constants, variables, or expressions.
- The result stores the computed product.

## 1. Integer Multiplication

Multiplying two integers yields an integer result.

```cpp filename="multiplication_integer.cpp" copy {6}
int a = 7, b = 4;
int product = a * b;
std::cout << "Product: " << product;  // Output: 28
```

---

## 2. Floating-Point Multiplication

Multiplication also works with `float` and `double` types and preserves decimal accuracy.

```cpp filename="multiplication_float.cpp" copy {6}
float x = 2.5, y = 4.0;
float result = x * y;
std::cout << "Product: " << result;  // Output: 10.0
```

```cpp filename="multiplication_double.cpp" copy {6}
double m = 3.1416, n = 2.0;
double area = m * n;
std::cout << "Area: " << area;  // Output: 6.2832
```

---

## 3. Mixed Type Multiplication (Int and Float/Double)

C++ automatically promotes the lower type when operands are of different types.

```cpp filename="multiplication_mixed.cpp" copy {6}
int a = 3;
double b = 2.5;
double result = a * b;
std::cout << "Result: " << result;  // Output: 7.5
```

---

## 4. Character Multiplication

Characters are stored as integers using ASCII codes. Multiplying characters results in an integer representing the product of their ASCII values.

```cpp filename="multiplication_char.cpp" copy {6}
char a = 'A'; // ASCII 65
char b = 2;
int result = a * b;
std::cout << "Result: " << result;  // Output: 130
```

---

## 5. Using Multiplication in Expressions

Multiplication is often used in arithmetic expressions and follows **higher precedence** than addition or subtraction.

```cpp filename="multiplication_expression.cpp" copy {6}
int result = 2 + 3 * 4;  // 2 + (3*4) = 14
std::cout << "Result: " << result;
```

---

## Practice Examples

### Example 1: Calculating Area of a Rectangle

```cpp filename="multiplication_practice1.cpp" copy {6}
int length = 10, width = 5;
int area = length * width;
std::cout << "Area: " << area;  // Output: 50
```

---

### Example 2: Multiplying Prices and Quantity

```cpp filename="multiplication_practice2.cpp" copy {6}
float price = 49.99;
int quantity = 3;
float total = price * quantity;
std::cout << "Total Price: " << total;  // Output: 149.97
```

---

### Example 3: Simple Interest Formula

```cpp filename="multiplication_practice3.cpp" copy {6}
float principal = 1000.0;
float rate = 5.0;
float time = 2;
float interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100;
std::cout << "Interest: " << interest;  // Output: 100.0
```

## Summary Table

| Data Type Combination | Expression  | Result Example            |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| Integer \* Integer    | `7 * 4`     | `28`                      |
| Float \* Float        | `2.5 * 4.0` | `10.0`                    |
| Int \* Float          | `3 * 2.5`   | `7.5` (promoted to float) |
| Double \* Int         | `3.14 * 2`  | `6.28`                    |
| Char \* Int           | `'A' * 2`   | `130` (ASCII 65 \* 2)     |

## Notes

- The multiplication operator has **higher precedence** than addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`), but lower than parentheses.
- When mixing data types, the result is promoted to the higher precision type.
- Multiplying with zero results in zero.
- Characters multiply based on their ASCII values and typically result in integer output.
