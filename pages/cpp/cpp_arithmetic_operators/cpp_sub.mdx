# Subtraction Operator in C++

The **subtraction operator (`-`)** in C++ is used to subtract one value from another. It can be applied to a variety of data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, and characters. Understanding how subtraction works with different types of data is essential for performing calculations in any C++ program.

---

## Syntax

```cpp
result = operand1 - operand2;
```

- `operand1` and `operand2` can be constants, variables, or expressions.
- The result holds the difference between the two values.

---

## 1. Integer Subtraction

When subtracting two integers, the result is an integer.

```cpp filename="subtraction_integer.cpp" copy {6}
int a = 15, b = 7;
int result = a - b;
std::cout << "Difference: " << result;  // Output: 8
```

---

## 2. Floating-Point Subtraction

When dealing with `float` or `double`, subtraction provides results with decimal precision.

```cpp filename="subtraction_float.cpp" copy {6}
float x = 10.5, y = 3.2;
float result = x - y;
std::cout << "Difference: " << result;  // Output: 7.3
```

```cpp filename="subtraction_double.cpp" copy {6}
double m = 100.55, n = 50.25;
double result = m - n;
std::cout << "Result: " << result;  // Output: 50.3
```

---

## 3. Integer and Floating-Point Mixed Subtraction

C++ automatically promotes the lower type (int) to the higher type (float/double) during mixed-type operations.

```cpp filename="subtraction_mixed.cpp" copy {6}
int a = 20;
double b = 4.75;
double result = a - b;
std::cout << "Result: " << result;  // Output: 15.25
```

---

## 4. Character Subtraction

Characters are internally stored as ASCII values. Subtracting characters gives the difference between their ASCII codes.

```cpp filename="subtraction_char.cpp" copy {6}
char a = 'D'; // ASCII 68
char b = 'A'; // ASCII 65
int result = a - b;
std::cout << "Result: " << result;  // Output: 3
```

---

## 5. Subtraction in Expressions

Subtraction is often used in mathematical expressions and formulas.

```cpp filename="subtraction_expression.cpp" copy {6}
int result = (10 + 5) - (3 * 2);  // 15 - 6 = 9
std::cout << "Result: " << result;
```

## Practice Examples

### Example 1: Finding Age Difference

```cpp filename="subtraction_practice1.cpp" copy {6}
int age1 = 30, age2 = 24;
int diff = age1 - age2;
std::cout << "Age Difference: " << diff;
```

---

### Example 2: Subtracting Float Measurements

```cpp filename="subtraction_practice2.cpp" copy {6}
float originalWeight = 65.75, lostWeight = 2.5;
float currentWeight = originalWeight - lostWeight;
std::cout << "Current Weight: " << currentWeight;
```

---

### Example 3: Character Distance

```cpp filename="subtraction_practice3.cpp" copy {6}
char first = 'z', second = 'v';
int gap = first - second;
std::cout << "Gap between characters: " << gap;
```

## Summary Table

| Data Type         | Expression   | Result Example            |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Integer - Integer | `15 - 7`     | `8`                       |
| Float - Float     | `10.5 - 3.2` | `7.3`                     |
| Double - Int      | `50.25 - 10` | `40.25`                   |
| Char - Char       | `'D' - 'A'`  | `3` (ASCII difference)    |
| Mixed Types       | `10 - 3.5`   | `6.5` (promoted to float) |

## Notes

- Subtraction is **left-associative** and follows standard arithmetic rules.
- When subtracting different types, the result type is automatically determined by promotion rules.
- Subtracting characters is a valid technique in ASCII-based calculations, such as alphabetical distance.
