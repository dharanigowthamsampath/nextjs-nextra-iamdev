# Comments in C++

Comments are notes written in your code to explain what it does. They are **ignored by the compiler** and serve purely for human readers — including your future self.

Writing clear comments helps make your code easier to understand, debug, and maintain. C++ supports two types of comments:

- **Single-line comments**
- **Multi-line comments**

---

## Single-line Comments

Single-line comments begin with `//`. Everything after `//` on that line is ignored by the compiler.

```cpp filename="single_line.cpp" copy {3}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // This is a single-line comment
    std::cout << "Single-line comment example" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### ✅ When to Use:

- To explain a single line of code
- To temporarily disable a line of code during debugging

---

## Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. They can span multiple lines and are useful for longer explanations.

```cpp filename="multi_line.cpp" copy {4, 5, 6}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    /* This is a multi-line comment.
       It spans across multiple lines.
       Useful for detailed explanations. */
    std::cout << "Multi-line comment example" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### ✅ When to Use:

- To describe a section of code
- For documentation-style comments at the top of files or functions

---

## ⚠️ Best Practices

- **Avoid over-commenting** obvious code. For example:

  ```cpp
  int x = 5; // declare an integer and assign 5 ← ❌ too obvious
  ```

- **Write meaningful comments** that explain why something is done, not just what is being done.

- **Keep comments up-to-date** as code changes.

## ✅ Summary

| Type        | Syntax          | Use Case                                   |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Single-line | `// comment`    | Quick, one-line explanations               |
| Multi-line  | `/* comment */` | Longer notes or temporarily disabling code |

Writing clean and helpful comments is a sign of professional programming. As your projects grow, good comments will save you and your teammates a lot of time and confusion.
