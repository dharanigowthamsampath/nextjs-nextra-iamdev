# C++ Program Structure

Every C++ program, no matter how complex, starts with a basic structure. Understanding this structure is crucial for beginners, as it lays the foundation for everything else you'll learn in C++. In this section, we’ll walk through the essential components of a C++ program and explain the purpose of each line using simple examples.

## Example 1: The Simplest C++ Program

```cpp filename="hello.cpp" copy
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- `#include <iostream>`
  This is a **preprocessor directive** that tells the compiler to include the **input-output stream** library. It's needed for `std::cout`, which is used to print output.

- `int main()`
  This is the **main function** — the entry point of every C++ program. The execution of your program starts here.

- `{ ... }`
  These curly braces define the **body** of the `main` function. All the code inside will be executed when the program runs.

- `std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;`
  This line prints the text `Hello, world!` to the console.

  - `std::cout` is the standard output stream.
  - `<<` is the stream insertion operator (used to send data to the output).
  - `std::endl` adds a **newline** and flushes the output buffer.

- `return 0;`
  This tells the operating system that the program has ended successfully.

## Example 2: Adding Comments and Variables

```cpp filename="hello.cpp" copy
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Declare a variable
    int age = 20;

    // Display the value
    std::cout << "Age: " << age << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- `// Declare a variable`
  This is a **single-line comment**. Comments are ignored by the compiler and are used to explain code.

- `int age = 20;`
  This declares an **integer variable** named `age` and initializes it with the value `20`.

- `"Age: " << age << std::endl`
  This combines a string with the value of the variable `age` and prints them together. Output: `Age: 20`.

## Example 3: Using Multiple Statements and Whitespace

```cpp filename="hello.cpp" copy
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;
    int sum = a + b;

    std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- `int a = 5; int b = 10;`
  Declares two integer variables `a` and `b`.

- `int sum = a + b;`
  Calculates the **sum** of `a` and `b`, and stores it in another variable `sum`.

- `std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;`
  Outputs the result of the addition. Output: `Sum: 15`.

- The use of indentation and spacing improves **readability** but has no effect on program execution.

## Summary

A basic C++ program includes:

| Component             | Description                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `#include <iostream>` | Adds standard input/output capabilities        |
| `main()`              | The starting point of program execution        |
| `{}`                  | Defines blocks of code                         |
| `std::cout`           | Used to display output to the screen           |
| `return 0;`           | Indicates successful completion of the program |
| `//` or `/* ... */`   | Used to write comments in the code             |
| Variables             | Store and manage data during program execution |

Mastering the structure of a C++ program is the first step toward becoming a confident programmer. In the next sections, we’ll explore each part of the language in more depth.
