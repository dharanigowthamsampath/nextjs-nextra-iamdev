# Array Operations in C

Arrays in C are versatile data structures that support a wide range of operations. These operations allow you to manipulate the data stored in arrays efficiently. The most common array operations include traversal, insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting. These operations can be performed on arrays of both predefined data types (like `int`, `float`, etc.) and user-defined types (like `structs`).

## 1. Traversing an Array

**Traversing** an array means accessing each element of the array one by one. It’s the first step when performing most array operations. You typically use a loop (like `for` or `while`) to traverse the array.

### Example: Traversing an Array of Integers

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};  // Declare and initialize array

    printf("Array elements: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {  // Loop to traverse array
        printf("%d ", numbers[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The array `numbers` is initialized with values. The `for` loop is used to traverse the array and print each element.

**Example Output:**

```
Array elements: 10 20 30 40 50
```

## 2. Insertion in an Array

**Insertion** involves adding an element at a specific position in the array. This operation usually requires shifting elements to make space for the new element. Inserting elements in the middle of an array may require shifting elements to the right to accommodate the new value.

### Example: Insertion in an Array of Integers

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int numbers[6] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};  // Declare and initialize array
    int n = 5;  // Current number of elements
    int newElement = 25;
    int position = 2;  // Inserting at position 2

    // Shift elements to the right
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= position; i--) {
        numbers[i + 1] = numbers[i];
    }

    // Insert new element
    numbers[position] = newElement;
    n++;

    // Print array after insertion
    printf("Array after insertion: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", numbers[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The element `25` is inserted at position `2` in the array. All elements from position 2 onward are shifted to the right.
- The array is printed after the insertion.

**Example Output:**

```
Array after insertion: 10 20 25 30 40 50
```

## 3. Deletion in an Array

**Deletion** involves removing an element from the array, usually from a specific position. After deletion, elements after the deleted element must be shifted to fill the gap, maintaining the contiguous memory structure of the array.

### Example: Deletion in an Array of Integers

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};  // Declare and initialize array
    int n = 5;  // Current number of elements
    int position = 2;  // Deleting element at position 2

    // Shift elements to the left
    for (int i = position; i < n - 1; i++) {
        numbers[i] = numbers[i + 1];
    }

    n--;  // Decrease the number of elements

    // Print array after deletion
    printf("Array after deletion: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", numbers[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The element at position `2` (which is `30`) is deleted. All elements after position `2` are shifted one place to the left.
- The array is printed after deletion.

**Example Output:**

```
Array after deletion: 10 20 40 50
```

## 4. Searching in an Array

**Searching** is the process of finding an element in an array. The most common types of searching algorithms are **linear search** (for unsorted arrays) and **binary search** (for sorted arrays). In this example, we’ll implement linear search, which is applicable to both sorted and unsorted arrays.

### Example: Linear Search in an Array of Integers

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};  // Declare and initialize array
    int searchElement = 30;  // Element to search for
    int found = -1;  // Variable to store index of found element

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        if (numbers[i] == searchElement) {
            found = i;
            break;  // Exit loop once element is found
        }
    }

    if (found != -1) {
        printf("Element %d found at index %d\n", searchElement, found);
    } else {
        printf("Element %d not found\n", searchElement);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- We search for the element `30` in the array using a linear search.
- The `found` variable holds the index of the element if it is found.

**Example Output:**

```
Element 30 found at index 2
```

## 5. Sorting an Array

**Sorting** is the process of arranging elements of the array in a specific order (ascending or descending). The most common sorting algorithms are **bubble sort**, **selection sort**, and **insertion sort**. In this example, we’ll implement **bubble sort** for sorting an array of integers in ascending order.

### Example: Bubble Sort on an Array of Integers

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int numbers[5] = {50, 10, 40, 20, 30};  // Unsorted array
    int n = 5;  // Number of elements

    // Bubble Sort Algorithm
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if (numbers[j] > numbers[j + 1]) {
                // Swap elements
                int temp = numbers[j];
                numbers[j] = numbers[j + 1];
                numbers[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }

    // Print sorted array
    printf("Array after sorting: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", numbers[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- We use the **bubble sort algorithm** to sort the array in ascending order. The algorithm repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- The sorted array is then printed.

**Example Output:**

```
Array after sorting: 10 20 30 40 50
```

## 6. Operations on Arrays of User-defined Types (Structs)

Arrays of **user-defined types** (like `structs`) can also be operated on similarly. You can traverse, insert, delete, search, and sort arrays of `struct` elements.

### Example: Searching in an Array of `struct`

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

struct Student {
    char name[50];
    int age;
};

int main() {
    struct Student students[3] = {
        {"Alice", 20},
        {"Bob", 22},
        {"Charlie", 21}
    };

    char searchName[] = "Bob";  // Name to search for
    int found = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        if (strcmp(students[i].name, searchName) == 0) {
            found = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (found != -1) {
        printf("Student %s found at index %d\n", searchName, found);
    } else {
        printf("Student %s not found\n", searchName);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- We search for a student by name in an array of `struct Student` using the `strcmp()` function to compare the names.

**Example Output:**

```
Student Bob found at index 1
```

## 7. Conclusion

Array operations are essential for manipulating and managing data in arrays. Here’s a quick recap of common array operations:
1. **Traversal**: Accessing and displaying all elements of an array.
2. **Insertion**: Adding a new element at a specific position, shifting other elements as needed.
3. **Deletion**: Removing an element and shifting remaining elements to fill the gap.
4. **Searching**: Finding an element using algorithms like linear search or binary search.
5. **Sorting**: Rearranging elements in a specific order using algorithms like bubble sort.

These operations can be applied to both predefined data types (like `int`, `float`, `char`) and user-defined types (like `structs`). Mastering these array operations will help you manage and manipulate data more effectively in C.
