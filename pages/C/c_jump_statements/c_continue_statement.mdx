# Understanding the `continue` Statement in C: A Beginner’s Guide

The **`continue` statement** in C is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move directly to the next iteration. Unlike the `break` statement, which terminates the loop entirely, the `continue` statement simply bypasses the remaining code in the current iteration while keeping the loop active.

In this blog, we will explore the `continue` statement with examples ranging from basic to complex, along with detailed explanations for absolute beginners.

---

## 1. What is the `continue` Statement?

The `continue` statement is primarily used when certain iterations of a loop need to be skipped based on a specific condition.

### **Syntax:**

```c
continue;
```

- When the `continue` statement is executed, all code following it in the loop is ignored for that iteration.
- The control goes directly to the next iteration.

---

## 2. Simple Example: Using `continue` in a `for` Loop

This program demonstrates how the `continue` statement works in a simple loop.

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        if (i == 5) {
            continue;  // Skip the iteration when i is 5
        }
        printf("%d ", i);
    }

    printf("\nLoop completed.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 10
Loop completed.
```

### Explanation:

1. The `for` loop starts at `i = 1` and increments up to `10`.
2. When `i == 5`, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the code for that iteration and moves to the next value of `i`.
3. As a result, `5` is not printed.

---

## 3. Practical Applications of `continue`

### **1. Skipping Even Numbers in a Loop**

This program demonstrates skipping specific values using the `continue` statement.

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Odd numbers between 1 and 10:\n");

    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            continue;  // Skip even numbers
        }
        printf("%d ", i);
    }

    printf("\nDone!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Odd numbers between 1 and 10:
1 3 5 7 9
Done!
```

### Explanation:

1. The `if` condition checks whether `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`).
2. If true, the `continue` statement skips printing `i`.
3. This results in only odd numbers being printed.

### **2. Filtering Specific Characters in a String**

This program demonstrates skipping specific characters when processing a string.

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char str[] = "hello world";
    printf("String without vowels: ");

    for (int i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        if (str[i] == 'a' || str[i] == 'e' || str[i] == 'i' || str[i] == 'o' || str[i] == 'u') {
            continue;  // Skip vowels
        }
        printf("%c", str[i]);
    }

    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
String without vowels: hll wrld
```

### Explanation:

1. The loop iterates through each character in the string.
2. The `if` condition checks if the character is a vowel.
3. If true, the `continue` statement skips printing the vowel.

---

### **3. Nested Loops with `continue`**

When used in nested loops, the `continue` statement affects only the innermost loop.

#### Example: Skipping Values in the Inner Loop

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
            if (j == 2) {
                continue;  // Skip the iteration when j == 2
            }
            printf("i = %d, j = %d\n", i, j);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
i = 1, j = 1
i = 1, j = 3
i = 2, j = 1
i = 2, j = 3
i = 3, j = 1
i = 3, j = 3
```

### Explanation:

- The `continue` statement skips the iteration in the inner loop (`j` loop) when `j == 2`.
- The outer loop (`i` loop) remains unaffected.

### **4. Skipping Specific Rows in a Multiplication Table**

This program skips rows where the multiplier is 5.

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        if (i == 5) {
            continue;  // Skip the 5th row
        }

        for (int j = 1; j <= 10; j++) {
            printf("%2d ", i * j);
        }

        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output (Partial):**

```
 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
 2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20
 3  6  9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30
 4  8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40
 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60
... (skipped row for 5)
```

## 4. Infinite Loops with `continue`

Using `continue` in an infinite loop allows selective skipping without terminating the loop.

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 0;

    while (1) {
        i++;

        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            continue;  // Skip even numbers
        }

        printf("%d ", i);

        if (i >= 10) {
            break;  // Exit the loop when i >= 10
        }
    }

    printf("\nLoop exited.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
1 3 5 7 9
Loop exited.
```

### Explanation:

1. The `continue` statement skips printing for even numbers.
2. The `break` statement ensures the loop exits after `i` reaches `10`.

---

## 5. Key Points to Remember

1. The `continue` statement skips the remaining code in the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.
2. It is especially useful for **filtering data** or **skipping unwanted conditions**.
3. When used in nested loops, it only affects the innermost loop.
4. Use `continue` cautiously to avoid making code harder to read.

---
