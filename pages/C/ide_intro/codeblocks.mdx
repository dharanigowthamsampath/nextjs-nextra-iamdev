# Getting Started with Code::Blocks

Code::Blocks is a free, open-source IDE that supports multiple compilers. Let's learn how to create and run your first C program using Code::Blocks.

## Creating Your First C Program

### Step 1: Create a New Project

1. Open Code::Blocks
2. Go to `File → New → Project`
3. Select "Console application" and click "Go"
4. Choose "C" as the language
5. Click "Next"
6. Enter your project title and choose location
7. Click "Finish"

### Step 2: Write the Code

Replace the default code with this Hello World program:

```c++ filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

#### Code Explanation:

- `#include <stdio.h>` - Includes the standard input/output library
- `int main()` - The main function where program execution begins
- `printf()` - Function to print text to the console
- `\n` - Newline character
- `return 0` - Indicates successful program completion

### Step 3: Build and Run

1. **Build the Program**:

   - Click `Build → Build` (F9) or
   - Click the gear icon in the toolbar

2. **Run the Program**:
   - Click `Build → Run` (F10) or
   - Click the green play button in the toolbar

You should see a console window appear with the output:

```bash filename="output"
Hello, World!
```

### Step 4: Understanding Build Messages

After building, you'll see messages in the "Build log" tab at the bottom:

- **Success**: "Process terminated with status 0" means no errors
- **Error**: Red text indicates compilation errors that need fixing

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Compiler Not Found

If you see "Compiler not found", you need to:

1. Go to `Settings → Compiler`
2. Select "GNU GCC Compiler"
3. Click "Auto-detect"
4. Click "OK"

### 2. Program Closes Immediately

Add this code before `return 0` to keep the console window open:

```c++ filename="main.c" copy
printf("Press Enter to continue...");
getchar();
```

## Best Practices

1. **Save Frequently**: Use Ctrl+S to save your work
2. **Use Auto-indent**: Press Ctrl+A, then Alt+I to format code
3. **Check Build Log**: Always review build messages for warnings

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your first program, try:

- Modifying the text in `printf()`
- Adding multiple `printf()` statements
- Using variables to store and display values

Remember to save your work frequently and experiment with different code modifications to better understand how C programming works in Code::Blocks.
