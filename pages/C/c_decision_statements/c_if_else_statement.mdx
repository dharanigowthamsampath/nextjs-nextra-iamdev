# Understanding the `if-else` Statement in C: A Beginner's Guide

The **`if-else` statement** in C is an extension of the basic `if` statement. It allows your program to take one of two possible paths based on a condition—one when the condition is **true**, and another when it is **false**. This helps make decisions more flexible and dynamic.

In this blog, we’ll explore the `if-else` statement in depth, including syntax, examples, and real-world applications.

## 1. What is an `if-else` Statement?

An `if-else` statement is used when you need to choose between **two mutually exclusive actions**.

- If the condition evaluates to **true**, the code inside the `if` block is executed.
- If the condition evaluates to **false**, the code inside the `else` block is executed.

### **Syntax:**

```c
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if the condition is false
}
```

- **Condition**: Any expression that evaluates to true (non-zero) or false (zero).
- **if block**: Code executed when the condition is true.
- **else block**: Code executed when the condition is false.

## 2. Basic Example

Let’s look at a simple example:

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number = -5;

    if (number >= 0) {  // Check if the number is non-negative
        printf("The number is non-negative.\n");
    } else {
        printf("The number is negative.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
The number is negative.
```

**Explanation:**

- The condition `number >= 0` is **false** because `-5` is less than `0`.
- The program skips the `if` block and executes the `else` block.

## 3. Practical Applications of `if-else`

### **1. Checking Even or Odd Numbers**

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    if (num % 2 == 0) {  // Check if the number is divisible by 2
        printf("%d is even.\n", num);
    } else {
        printf("%d is odd.\n", num);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output (Example):**

```
Enter a number: 7
7 is odd.
```

### **2. Grading System**

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int marks;

    printf("Enter your marks: ");
    scanf("%d", &marks);

    if (marks >= 50) {  // Check if marks are 50 or above
        printf("You passed the exam.\n");
    } else {
        printf("You failed the exam.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output (Example):**

```
Enter your marks: 45
You failed the exam.
```

## 4. Edge Cases and Tips

### **1. Multiple Statements in Blocks**

Both `if` and `else` blocks can have multiple statements. Always use braces `{}` to group them.

```c
if (condition) {
    // Multiple statements for true
    statement1;
    statement2;
} else {
    // Multiple statements for false
    statement3;
    statement4;
}
```

### **2. Nested `if-else` Statements**

You can nest `if-else` statements to handle more complex conditions.

```c
if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
        // Nested if block
    } else {
        // Nested else block
    }
} else {
    // Outer else block
}
```

## Summary

- The `if-else` statement provides a choice between **two paths** in a program.
- The `if` block executes when the condition is **true**, and the `else` block executes when it is **false**.
- It’s a useful tool for making **binary decisions** like checking positive/negative numbers, even/odd numbers, or pass/fail conditions.

In the next post, we’ll explore the `else if` ladder for handling multiple conditions. Stay tuned!
