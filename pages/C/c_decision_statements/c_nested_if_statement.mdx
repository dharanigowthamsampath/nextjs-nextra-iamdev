# Understanding Nested `if` Statements in C: A Beginner's Guide

The **nested `if` statement** in C allows you to check multiple conditions in a hierarchical manner. It is essentially an `if` statement inside another `if` or `else` block. This enables your program to make decisions that depend on multiple criteria.

In this blog, we’ll explore nested `if` statements in depth, including syntax, examples, and practical applications with detailed explanations.

## 1. What is a Nested `if` Statement?

A **nested `if` statement** is an `if` statement that appears inside another `if` or `else` block. This structure is useful when a decision depends on multiple levels of conditions.

### **Syntax:**

```c
if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
        // Code to execute if both condition1 and condition2 are true
    } else {
        // Code to execute if condition1 is true but condition2 is false
    }
} else {
    // Code to execute if condition1 is false
}
```

- The outer `if` evaluates **condition1**.
- If **condition1** is true, the inner `if` evaluates **condition2**.
- If **condition1** is false, the program executes the `else` block.

## 2. Basic Example

Let’s start with a simple nested `if` example to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    if (number > 0) {
        if (number % 2 == 0) {
            printf("The number is positive and even.\n");
        } else {
            printf("The number is positive and odd.\n");
        }
    } else if (number < 0) {
        printf("The number is negative.\n");
    } else {
        printf("The number is zero.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output (Examples):**

1. Input: `4`
   ```
   The number is positive and even.
   ```
2. Input: `-3`
   ```
   The number is negative.
   ```
3. Input: `0`
   ```
   The number is zero.
   ```

## 3. Practical Applications of Nested `if`

### **1. Determining a Student’s Grade**

This program assigns grades based on marks:

```
- **Marks >= 90**: Grade A
- **Marks >= 75 but < 90**: Grade B
- **Marks >= 50 but < 75**: Grade C
- **Marks < 50**: Fail
```

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int marks;

    printf("Enter your marks: ");
    scanf("%d", &marks);

    if (marks >= 50) {
        if (marks >= 90) {
            printf("You scored Grade A.\n");
        } else if (marks >= 75) {
            printf("You scored Grade B.\n");
        } else {
            printf("You scored Grade C.\n");
        }
    } else {
        printf("You failed the exam.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output (Examples):**

1. Input: `95`
   ```
   You scored Grade A.
   ```
2. Input: `80`
   ```
   You scored Grade B.
   ```
3. Input: `45`
   ```
   You failed the exam.
   ```

### **2. Finding the Largest of Three Numbers**

This program uses nested `if` statements to identify the largest number among three.

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b, c;

    printf("Enter three numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);

    if (a >= b) {
        if (a >= c) {
            printf("%d is the largest number.\n", a);
        } else {
            printf("%d is the largest number.\n", c);
        }
    } else {
        if (b >= c) {
            printf("%d is the largest number.\n", b);
        } else {
            printf("%d is the largest number.\n", c);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output (Examples):**

1. Input: `5 10 8`
   ```
   10 is the largest number.
   ```
2. Input: `12 4 12`
   ```
   12 is the largest number.
   ```

## 4. Advanced Example: Calculating Income Tax

This program calculates income tax based on income brackets:

```
- **Income <= 250,000**: No tax
- **Income > 250,000 but <= 500,000**: 5% tax
- **Income > 500,000 but <= 1,000,000**: 20% tax
- **Income > 1,000,000**: 30% tax
```

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    double income, tax;

    printf("Enter your annual income: ");
    scanf("%lf", &income);

    if (income > 250000) {
        if (income <= 500000) {
            tax = (income - 250000) * 0.05;
        } else if (income <= 1000000) {
            tax = (250000 * 0.05) + ((income - 500000) * 0.20);
        } else {
            tax = (250000 * 0.05) + (500000 * 0.20) + ((income - 1000000) * 0.30);
        }
        printf("Your tax amount is: %.2lf\n", tax);
    } else {
        printf("No tax applicable.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output (Examples):**

1. Input: `400000`
   ```
   Your tax amount is: 7500.00
   ```
2. Input: `1200000`
   ```
   Your tax amount is: 190000.00
   ```

## 5. Key Points to Remember

- **Braces `{}` are essential**: Always use braces for clarity, even if a block contains only one statement.
- Nested `if` statements can become complex. Use proper indentation to improve readability.
- **Avoid deep nesting**: For highly complex logic, consider using other constructs like `switch` or functions.

## Summary

The **nested `if` statement** provides a way to check multiple conditions in a hierarchical structure. It is particularly useful for problems that require multiple levels of decision-making, like grading systems, tax calculations, or comparing numbers.

By mastering nested `if` statements, you’ll gain a powerful tool for solving complex programming problems efficiently. In the next post, we’ll dive into **switch statements**, another tool for decision-making in C. Stay tuned!
