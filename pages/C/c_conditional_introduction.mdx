## Introduction to Control Structures in C

Control structures in C are the building blocks that control the flow of a program. Without them, your program would simply execute one line after another in a fixed order. But real-world problems often need decisions and repetition—for example, choosing what to do based on a condition or performing the same task multiple times.

### Why Are Control Structures Important?

Control structures allow you to:

1. **Make Decisions**: Decide what to do when certain conditions are met.
2. **Repeat Tasks**: Automate repetitive actions efficiently.
3. **Control Program Flow**: Handle complex logic by branching or looping.

### Types of Control Structures in C

Control structures in C are mainly of three types:

1. **Sequential**: Executes statements in order, line by line.
2. **Decision-making**: Executes different blocks of code based on conditions (e.g., `if`, `else`, `switch`).
3. **Looping**: Repeats a block of code (e.g., `for`, `while`, `do-while`).

In upcoming posts, we’ll dive into each of these with examples to make it simple and beginner-friendly!
