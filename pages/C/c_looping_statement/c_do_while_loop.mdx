# Understanding the `do-while` Loop in C: A Beginner’s Guide

The **`do-while` loop** is a control structure in C that guarantees the loop body executes at least once, regardless of the condition's initial value. This makes it distinct from the `while` loop, which checks the condition before execution.

In this blog, we will dive into the `do-while` loop with examples ranging from simple to complex, with detailed explanations for absolute beginners.

## 1. What is a `do-while` Loop?

A **`do-while` loop** executes the block of code first, then evaluates the condition. If the condition is true, the loop continues; otherwise, it terminates.

### **Syntax:**

```c
do {
    // Code to execute
} while (condition);
```

- The loop body is guaranteed to execute at least once, even if the condition is false initially.
- The **semicolon (;)** after the `while` condition is mandatory.

## 2. Simple Example

Let’s start with a basic example: printing numbers from 1 to 5.

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 1;  // Initialization

    do {
        printf("%d ", i);
        i++;  // Update
    } while (i <= 5);  // Condition

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
1 2 3 4 5
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: Variable `i` is set to 1.
2. **Execution**: The loop body runs, printing the value of `i` and incrementing it.
3. **Condition**: After each iteration, the condition `i <= 5` is checked. If true, the loop repeats.

## 3. Practical Applications of `do-while` Loops

### **1. User Input Validation**

This program ensures the user enters a number within a specified range.

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number;

    do {
        printf("Enter a number between 1 and 10: ");
        scanf("%d", &number);

        if (number < 1 || number > 10) {
            printf("Invalid input! Please try again.\n");
        }
    } while (number < 1 || number > 10);  // Condition to repeat on invalid input

    printf("You entered: %d\n", number);
    return 0;
}
```

**Output (Examples):**

1. Input: `15, 0, 7`
   ```
   Enter a number between 1 and 10: 15
   Invalid input! Please try again.
   Enter a number between 1 and 10: 0
   Invalid input! Please try again.
   Enter a number between 1 and 10: 7
   You entered: 7
   ```

### **2. Sum of Positive Numbers Until a Negative Number is Entered**

This program calculates the sum of positive numbers entered by the user until they enter a negative number.

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num, sum = 0;

    do {
        printf("Enter a positive number (negative to stop): ");
        scanf("%d", &num);

        if (num >= 0) {
            sum += num;  // Add positive numbers to the sum
        }
    } while (num >= 0);  // Stop when a negative number is entered

    printf("The sum of positive numbers is %d.\n", sum);
    return 0;
}
```

**Output (Example):**

1. Input: `10, 20, -1`
   ```
   Enter a positive number (negative to stop): 10
   Enter a positive number (negative to stop): 20
   Enter a positive number (negative to stop): -1
   The sum of positive numbers is 30.
   ```

### **3. Repeatedly Display a Menu Until the User Exits**

This program displays a menu and processes the user's choice until they decide to exit.

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int choice;

    do {
        printf("\nMenu:\n");
        printf("1. Print Hello\n");
        printf("2. Print Goodbye\n");
        printf("3. Exit\n");
        printf("Enter your choice: ");
        scanf("%d", &choice);

        switch (choice) {
            case 1:
                printf("Hello!\n");
                break;
            case 2:
                printf("Goodbye!\n");
                break;
            case 3:
                printf("Exiting...\n");
                break;
            default:
                printf("Invalid choice! Try again.\n");
        }
    } while (choice != 3);  // Repeat until the user selects Exit (3)

    return 0;
}
```

**Output (Example):**

```
Menu:
1. Print Hello
2. Print Goodbye
3. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Hello!

Menu:
1. Print Hello
2. Print Goodbye
3. Exit
Enter your choice: 3
Exiting...
```

### **4. Reverse a Number**

This program reverses the digits of a given number using a `do-while` loop.

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num, reversed = 0;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    do {
        int digit = num % 10;  // Extract the last digit
        reversed = reversed * 10 + digit;  // Build the reversed number
        num /= 10;  // Remove the last digit
    } while (num != 0);  // Repeat until all digits are processed

    printf("Reversed number: %d\n", reversed);
    return 0;
}
```

**Output (Examples):**

1. Input: `1234`
   ```
   Reversed number: 4321
   ```

### **5. Infinite Loop Example**

Sometimes, `do-while` loops can be used to create intentional infinite loops.

#### Example: Continuously Print Numbers

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 1;

    do {
        printf("%d ", i);
        i++;
    } while (1);  // This condition is always true, creating an infinite loop

    return 0;
}
```

**Note:** This program will continue indefinitely and must be terminated manually.

---

## 4. Nested `do-while` Loops

Nested `do-while` loops are useful for multi-level tasks, such as printing patterns.

#### Example: Printing a Square Pattern

```c filename="main.c" copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int rows, cols, i = 1;

    printf("Enter the number of rows and columns: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &rows, &cols);

    do {
        int j = 1;
        do {
            printf("* ");
            j++;
        } while (j <= cols);  // Inner loop for columns
        printf("\n");
        i++;
    } while (i <= rows);  // Outer loop for rows

    return 0;
}
```

**Output (Example):**

1. Input: `3 4`
   ```
   * * * *
   * * * *
   * * * *
   ```

## 5. Key Points to Remember

1. The **`do-while` loop** ensures the loop body executes at least once.
2. Use the **semicolon (;)** after the `while` condition.
3. Avoid infinite loops by ensuring the condition will eventually become false.
4. Use nested `do-while` loops for multi-dimensional tasks.

---

## Summary

The **`do-while` loop** is a powerful construct when you need to guarantee execution at least once, such as for user input validation or menu-driven programs. Understanding its behavior and syntax is crucial for mastering control flow in C programming.

In the next blog, we’ll explore **jump statements (break, continue, and goto)** to control the flow within loops. Stay tuned!
