# ORDER BY Clause

The `ORDER BY` clause in SQL is used to **sort the result set** of a `SELECT` query.

By default, when you run a `SELECT` query, MySQL returns the results in no particular order — it depends on how the database stores the data internally. If you want to display the results in a specific order (for example, by name or by date), you use the `ORDER BY` clause.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
ORDER BY column_name [ASC | DESC];
```

- `ASC` means ascending order (smallest to largest, A to Z). This is the default.
- `DESC` means descending order (largest to smallest, Z to A).

### Example Table: `students`

| id  | name         | age | email                                         | enrollment_date |
| --- | ------------ | --- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1   | Alice Smith  | 20  | [alice@example.com](mailto:alice@example.com) | 2025-06-23      |
| 2   | Bob Johnson  | 22  | [bob@example.com](mailto:bob@example.com)     | 2025-06-20      |
| 3   | Carol Thomas | 19  | [carol@example.com](mailto:carol@example.com) | 2025-06-21      |
| 4   | Dan Green    | 23  | [dan@example.com](mailto:dan@example.com)     | 2025-06-19      |

### Example 1: Order by Age (Ascending)

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY age ASC;
```

Result:

| id  | name         | age | email                                         | enrollment_date |
| --- | ------------ | --- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------- |

| 1   | Alice Smith  | 20  | [alice@example.com](mailto:alice@example.com) | 2025-06-23      |
| 2   | Bob Johnson  | 22  | [bob@example.com](mailto:bob@example.com)     | 2025-06-20      |
| 4   | Dan Green    | 23  | [dan@example.com](mailto:dan@example.com)     | 2025-06-19      |

### Example 2: Order by Name (Alphabetical)

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY name ASC;
```

---

### Example 3: Order by Enrollment Date (Newest First)

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY enrollment_date DESC;
```

This will display the students who enrolled most recently at the top.

---

### Example 4: Order by Multiple Columns

You can order by more than one column.
For example, order first by age (ascending), then by name (ascending):

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY age ASC, name ASC;
```

This helps when two or more rows have the same value in the first column — it uses the second column to break ties.

---

### Important Notes

- The `ORDER BY` clause always goes **after** the `WHERE` clause (if there is one).
- You can order by any column — it does not need to be one you are selecting.
- By default, sorting is in ascending order.

---

### Summary

- `ORDER BY` is used to **sort query results**.
- You can sort in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.
- You can order by one or multiple columns.
- Sorting helps make query results easier to read and analyze.
