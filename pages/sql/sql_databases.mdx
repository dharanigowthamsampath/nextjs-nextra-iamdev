# Databases and Tables

#### What is a Database?

A **database** is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. In the context of MySQL (and other relational database systems), a database is a container that holds related **tables**, and each table stores specific types of information in a structured format.

Think of a database as a **digital filing cabinet**, where:

- Each **folder** inside the cabinet represents a **table**.
- Each **sheet of paper** inside a folder represents a **record (or row)**.
- Each **column** on the sheet holds a specific type of information (such as a name, ID number, or date).

#### Why Use a Database?

Before databases, data was often stored in spreadsheets or simple files. However, databases offer many advantages:

- Data is organized and consistent.
- Data can be searched and filtered quickly.
- Relationships between different sets of data can be defined and managed.
- Access control and security can be applied.
- Large amounts of data can be handled efficiently.

#### MySQL and Relational Databases

MySQL is a **relational database management system (RDBMS)**, meaning it organizes data into **tables with rows and columns**, and allows relationships between tables.

Each database in MySQL can contain:

- One or more **tables**
- Views
- Stored procedures
- Triggers
- Other database objects

#### What is a Table?

A **table** is the fundamental building block of a relational database. It represents a collection of related data in rows and columns.

**Example Table: `students`**

| id  | name         | age | email                                         |
| --- | ------------ | --- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Alice Smith  | 20  | [alice@example.com](mailto:alice@example.com) |
| 2   | Bob Johnson  | 22  | [bob@example.com](mailto:bob@example.com)     |
| 3   | Carol Thomas | 19  | [carol@example.com](mailto:carol@example.com) |

- Each **row** is called a **record**.
- Each **column** is called a **field** or **attribute**.
- Each column has a specific **data type**, like `INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`, etc.

#### Creating a Database

To create a new database in MySQL, use the following command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE college;
```

This creates an empty database named `college`.

To switch to that database:

```sql
USE college;
```

Now all subsequent operations will happen inside the `college` database.

---

#### Creating a Table

Once inside a database, you can create a table using the `CREATE TABLE` command. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  age INT,
  email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

Explanation:

- `id`: an integer field that uniquely identifies each student
- `name`: a text field up to 100 characters
- `age`: a number representing the studentâ€™s age
- `email`: a text field up to 100 characters

---

#### Inserting Data into the Table

You can add rows (records) into the table using the `INSERT INTO` statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age, email)
VALUES (1, 'Alice Smith', 20, 'alice@example.com');
```

---

#### Viewing the Data

To view the data inside the table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
```

This will return all rows and columns from the `students` table.

#### Summary

- A **database** stores and organizes data.
- A **table** is a structure inside the database that holds data in rows and columns.
- Each table has a defined structure with named columns and specific data types.
- MySQL allows creation, modification, and querying of databases and tables using simple commands.

Learning how databases and tables work is the first and most important step toward understanding how data is stored, structured, and used in real-world applications.
