# NOT NULL Constraint

By default, columns in a table can accept **NULL** values — meaning that the value is unknown or missing.

When you apply the **NOT NULL** constraint to a column:

- It ensures that the column **must always have a value**.
- You cannot insert a row without providing a value for that column.
- It helps enforce that required data is always present.

---

### Why Use NOT NULL?

- To ensure important fields (such as `name`, `email`, `created_at`) are **never empty**.
- To improve **data quality** — no missing critical data.
- It is often used for required fields in business applications.

---

### Basic Syntax

```sql
column_name data_type NOT NULL
```

---

### Example 1: Students Table with NOT NULL Columns

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  enrollment_date DATE
);
```

In this example:

- `name` and `email` must always have values.
- `enrollment_date` is optional (it can be NULL if not provided).

---

### Example 2: Inserting Data (Valid)

```sql
INSERT INTO students (name, email, enrollment_date)
VALUES ('Alice Smith', 'alice@example.com', '2025-06-23');
```

This works because `name` and `email` are provided.

---

### Example 3: Inserting Data (Invalid)

```sql
INSERT INTO students (email, enrollment_date)
VALUES ('alice@example.com', '2025-06-23');
```

Error: Column `name` cannot be null.

You **must provide a value** for every `NOT NULL` column.

---

### Example 4: Modifying a Table to Add NOT NULL

You can also modify an existing column to be NOT NULL:

```sql
ALTER TABLE students
MODIFY COLUMN email VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL;
```

---

### Example 5: Multiple NOT NULL Columns

```sql
CREATE TABLE courses (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  course_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  instructor VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  start_date DATE NOT NULL,
  end_date DATE
);
```

In this example:

- `course_name`, `instructor`, and `start_date` must always be present.
- `end_date` is optional.

---

### Important Notes

- If a column is defined as **NOT NULL**, you must provide a value for it in every `INSERT`.
- If you try to leave it empty or insert `NULL`, you will get an error.
- Many columns that are used as **primary keys** or **foreign keys** are also defined as NOT NULL.

---

### Summary

- **NOT NULL** prevents columns from having empty (NULL) values.
- It enforces that required fields always have data.
- You can apply NOT NULL to any column.
- It improves **data quality** and **reliability** of your database.
