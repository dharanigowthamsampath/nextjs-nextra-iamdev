# Primary Key

In relational databases like MySQL, every table should have a way to uniquely identify each row.
The **primary key** provides this unique identifier.

### What is a Primary Key?

- A **primary key** is one or more columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table.
- No two rows can have the same primary key value.
- A primary key **cannot be NULL** (it must always have a value).
- Each table should have exactly **one** primary key.

---

### Why Use a Primary Key?

- Ensures **uniqueness**: No duplicate rows.
- Provides a reliable way to **reference** rows (for example, when using foreign keys).
- Improves **data integrity**.
- Often used for indexing, which helps improve query performance.

### Example Table with Primary Key

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  age INT,
  email VARCHAR(150),
  enrollment_date DATE
);
```

In this example:

- `id` is the primary key.
- Each student must have a unique `id` value.
- No two students can have the same `id`.
- The `id` cannot be NULL.

---

### Example: Inserting Unique Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age, email, enrollment_date)
VALUES (1, 'Alice Smith', 20, 'alice@example.com', '2025-06-23');
```

If you try to insert another row with `id = 1`, it will cause an error:

```sql
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age, email, enrollment_date)
VALUES (1, 'Bob Johnson', 22, 'bob@example.com', '2025-06-20');
```

Error: Duplicate entry '1' for primary key.

---

### Composite Primary Key

A primary key can also consist of **multiple columns** â€” this is called a composite primary key.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
  student_id INT,
  course_id INT,
  enrollment_date DATE,
  PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);
```

In this example:

- The combination of `student_id` and `course_id` uniquely identifies each row.
- A student can enroll in multiple courses, but not in the same course more than once.

---

### Common Practices

- Often the primary key is a single column named `id` or `tablename_id`.
- Many developers use **auto-incrementing IDs** so that the database automatically generates a new ID for each row (you will learn this in the next section).

---

### Summary

- A **primary key** uniquely identifies each row in a table.
- It ensures that no two rows can have the same key.
- A primary key cannot be NULL.
- Every table should have exactly one primary key.
- It can be one column or a combination of multiple columns.
