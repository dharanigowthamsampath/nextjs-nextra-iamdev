### **Overview**

#### What is MySQL?

MySQL is an **open-source relational database management system (RDBMS)**.
It is one of the most popular systems in the world for storing, managing, and retrieving structured data.

- **Relational** means that the data is stored in **tables** (similar to spreadsheets), where relationships between tables can be defined.
- **Database Management System (DBMS)** means software that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data efficiently.

MySQL is widely used in **web applications, enterprise software, mobile apps, and data-driven systems** â€” essentially anywhere data needs to be stored and retrieved.
