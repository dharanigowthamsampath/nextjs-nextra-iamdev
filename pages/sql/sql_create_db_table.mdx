# Creating Databases and Tables

#### What is a Database?

A **database** is a container that holds related data.
In MySQL, a database contains one or more **tables**.

Each **table** organizes data in **rows** and **columns**, similar to an Excel spreadsheet.

- A **row** represents a single record (example: one student, one employee).
- A **column** represents a field (example: name, age, email).

Before you can store any data in MySQL, you must first create a database, then create tables inside it.

### Creating a Database

To create a new database, use the `CREATE DATABASE` command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE school;
```

This creates a new empty database named `school`.

To select that database and start working inside it:

```sql
USE school;
```

Now all tables you create will be part of the `school` database.

### Creating a Table

To store data, you must create **tables** inside your database.
Each table has:

- A **name**
- A list of **columns**, each with a name and data type

**Example**: Creating a `students` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  age INT,
  email VARCHAR(150),
  enrollment_date DATE
);
```

Explanation:

- `id`: an integer value that uniquely identifies each student
- `name`: student’s name (text up to 100 characters)
- `age`: student’s age (integer)
- `email`: student’s email address (text up to 150 characters)
- `enrollment_date`: the date the student enrolled

---

### Key Points

- Every table **must** have a unique name.
- Each column must have:

  - A unique name within the table
  - A data type that defines the kind of data it can store

- It is a good practice to include a **PRIMARY KEY** column, which uniquely identifies each row. Often this is an `id` column.

---

### Example: Full Workflow

```sql
-- Step 1: Create database
CREATE DATABASE school;

-- Step 2: Use the database
USE school;

-- Step 3: Create table
CREATE TABLE teachers (
  teacher_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  subject VARCHAR(100),
  hire_date DATE
);
```

### Viewing Databases and Tables

To see a list of all databases:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

To see all tables in the current database:

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

To view the structure (columns) of a table:

```sql
DESCRIBE students;
```

---

### Summary

- `CREATE DATABASE`: creates a new database
- `CREATE TABLE`: defines the structure of a table
- Each column must have a name and data type
- Good practice: always include a **PRIMARY KEY** to uniquely identify rows
- Use `SHOW DATABASES`, `SHOW TABLES`, `DESCRIBE` to explore the database structure
