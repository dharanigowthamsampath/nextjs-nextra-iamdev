# DELETE Query

The `DELETE` statement in SQL is used to **remove rows** from a table.

You can delete:

- A single row
- Multiple rows
- All rows (if used without `WHERE` — with caution)

---

### Basic Syntax

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

- `DELETE FROM`: specifies the table you want to delete rows from
- `WHERE`: filters which rows will be deleted

  - If you omit `WHERE`, **all rows in the table will be deleted**

### Example Table: `students`

| id  | name         | age | email                                         | enrollment_date |
| --- | ------------ | --- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1   | Alice Smith  | 20  | [alice@example.com](mailto:alice@example.com) | 2025-06-23      |
| 2   | Bob Johnson  | 22  | [bob@example.com](mailto:bob@example.com)     | 2025-06-20      |
| 3   | Carol Thomas | 19  | [carol@example.com](mailto:carol@example.com) | 2025-06-21      |
| 4   | Dan Green    | 23  | [dan@example.com](mailto:dan@example.com)     | 2025-06-19      |

### Example 1: Delete One Row

Delete the student with `id = 3`:

```sql
DELETE FROM students
WHERE id = 3;
```

---

### Example 2: Delete Rows Matching a Condition

Delete all students older than 22:

```sql
DELETE FROM students
WHERE age > 22;
```

---

### Example 3: Delete All Rows (No WHERE)

**Caution:** This will remove all rows from the table:

```sql
DELETE FROM students;
```

The table will still exist, but it will be empty.

---

### Important Notes

- Always use `WHERE` unless you are absolutely sure you want to delete all rows.
- Once rows are deleted, the data **cannot be recovered** unless a backup exists.
- If you only want to temporarily "hide" data instead of deleting it, consider using an `is_active` column instead of physically deleting rows.

---

### Summary

- `DELETE` removes rows from a table.
- `WHERE` filters which rows to delete — **be careful** when using `DELETE`.
- If `WHERE` is omitted, all rows will be deleted.
- Deleting data is permanent — use backups and test carefully.
