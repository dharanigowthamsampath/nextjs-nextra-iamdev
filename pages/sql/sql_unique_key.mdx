# UNIQUE Constraint

The **UNIQUE** constraint ensures that all values in a column (or a combination of columns) are **unique** â€” no duplicate values are allowed.

It is used to enforce **data integrity**:
Certain pieces of data (such as email addresses or usernames) should appear only once in a table.

---

### Why Use UNIQUE?

- To prevent **duplicate entries**.
- To ensure certain fields are **distinct**.
- To enforce **business rules** (for example, each student must have a unique email).

---

### Basic Syntax

When creating a table:

```sql
column_name data_type UNIQUE
```

Or as a table-level constraint:

```sql
UNIQUE (column1, column2, ...)
```

---

### Example: Students with Unique Email

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(150) UNIQUE
);
```

In this example:

- The `email` column has a UNIQUE constraint.
- You cannot insert two students with the same email.

---

### Example: Attempting to Insert Duplicate

```sql
INSERT INTO students (name, email)
VALUES ('Alice Smith', 'alice@example.com');

INSERT INTO students (name, email)
VALUES ('Bob Johnson', 'alice@example.com');  -- This will cause an error!
```

Error: Duplicate entry for `email`.

---

### UNIQUE Across Multiple Columns (Composite UNIQUE)

You can also define a UNIQUE constraint on a combination of columns:

```sql
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
  student_id INT,
  course_id INT,
  enrollment_date DATE,
  UNIQUE (student_id, course_id)
);
```

In this example:

- A student can enroll in a course **only once**.
- The same `student_id` and `course_id` combination cannot appear twice.

---

### Key Differences: UNIQUE vs PRIMARY KEY

| PRIMARY KEY         | UNIQUE                           |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| One per table       | Multiple UNIQUE allowed          |
| Cannot be NULL      | Can allow NULL (depends on DBMS) |
| Enforces uniqueness | Enforces uniqueness              |

---

### Summary

- **UNIQUE** ensures no duplicate values in a column (or columns).
- It helps enforce **data integrity**.
- You can use multiple UNIQUE constraints in one table.
- It complements the **PRIMARY KEY**, which is always UNIQUE itself.
