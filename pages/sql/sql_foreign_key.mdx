# FOREIGN KEY

A **foreign key** is a column (or a set of columns) that creates a **relationship between two tables**.

- The foreign key in one table points to the **primary key** in another table.
- This enforces **referential integrity**: it ensures that the data in the related columns stays consistent.

---

### Why Use FOREIGN KEY?

- To **link related data** across multiple tables.
- To avoid **duplicate** or **inconsistent** data.
- To help model **real-world relationships** between entities.

---

### Example: Real-World Scenario

Suppose you have:

1. A table of **students**
2. A table of **courses**
3. A table of **enrollments** (which records which students are enrolled in which courses)

The `enrollments` table will have **foreign keys** pointing to the `students` table and the `courses` table.

---

### Basic Syntax

When creating a table:

```sql
FOREIGN KEY (column_name) REFERENCES parent_table(parent_column)
```

---

### Example: Students and Enrollments

**Table 1: students**

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(150)
);
```

**Table 2: courses**

```sql
CREATE TABLE courses (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  course_name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

**Table 3: enrollments**

```sql
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id INT,
  course_id INT,
  enrollment_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(id)
);
```

In this example:

- `student_id` in `enrollments` is a foreign key that refers to `id` in `students`.
- `course_id` in `enrollments` is a foreign key that refers to `id` in `courses`.

---

### How It Works

- You **cannot insert** an enrollment for a student unless that student exists in the `students` table.
- You **cannot insert** an enrollment for a course unless that course exists in the `courses` table.
- If you try to delete a student or course that is referenced in `enrollments`, you will get an error unless special rules (such as `ON DELETE CASCADE`) are defined.

---

### Benefits of FOREIGN KEY

- Maintains **data consistency** across tables.
- Helps ensure that relationships between tables are valid.
- Prevents accidental deletion of related data.

---

### Summary

- A **foreign key** links one table to another.
- It references a **primary key** in the parent table.
- It enforces **referential integrity** â€” relationships stay consistent.
- It is essential for modeling complex data and building reliable databases.
