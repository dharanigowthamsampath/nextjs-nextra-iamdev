# Data Types

When creating tables in MySQL, each column must be assigned a **data type**. A data type defines:

- The kind of data that column can store (for example, numbers, text, dates).
- The amount of storage space required.
- The operations that can be performed on that column.

Choosing the correct data type is very important for:

- Accuracy of data
- Efficient storage
- Better performance of queries

#### Why Do We Need Data Types?

Every field in a table should store a specific kind of data. For example:

- A student’s **age** should be stored as a number, not as text.
- A student’s **name** should be stored as text.
- A **date of birth** should be stored in a date format.

If the wrong data type is used, it can cause:

- Errors when inserting or updating data
- Incorrect query results
- Wasted storage space

#### Categories of Data Types

MySQL provides many data types. The most commonly used ones fall into these categories:

1. Numeric Data Types
2. String (Character) Data Types
3. Date and Time Data Types
4. Other types (less common, used in special cases)

---

#### 1. Numeric Data Types

Numeric types store numbers, either integers or floating-point values.

| Data Type     | Description                                    | Example             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| INT           | Whole numbers                                  | 10, 100, -50        |
| TINYINT       | Very small integers (-128 to 127)              | 1, 2, 3             |
| SMALLINT      | Small integers                                 | 32767               |
| BIGINT        | Very large integers                            | 9223372036854775807 |
| DECIMAL(x, y) | Exact numeric values with fixed decimal places | 99.99               |
| FLOAT         | Approximate floating-point values              | 3.1415              |
| DOUBLE        | Larger floating-point values                   | 3.1415926535        |

Example usage:

```sql
age INT;
price DECIMAL(10, 2);
```

#### 2. String (Character) Data Types

String types store text data, like names or descriptions.

| Data Type  | Description                                | Example                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| CHAR(n)    | Fixed-length string (n characters)         | 'YES', 'NO'            |
| VARCHAR(n) | Variable-length string, up to n characters | 'Alice', 'Hello World' |
| TEXT       | Long text data (articles, comments)        | 'This is a long note.' |

Example usage:

```sql
name VARCHAR(100);
email VARCHAR(150);
```

---

#### 3. Date and Time Data Types

Date and time types store temporal (time-related) data.

| Data Type | Description                                  | Example               |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| DATE      | Stores dates (year, month, day)              | '2025-06-23'          |
| TIME      | Stores time (hours, minutes, sec)            | '14:30:00'            |
| DATETIME  | Stores date and time                         | '2025-06-23 14:30:00' |
| TIMESTAMP | Stores date and time with timezone awareness | '2025-06-23 14:30:00' |

Example usage:

```sql
created_at DATETIME;
birth_date DATE;
```

#### Choosing the Right Data Type

Here are some simple guidelines:

| Type of Data               | Recommended Data Type |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Whole numbers              | INT or BIGINT         |
| Decimal numbers (currency) | DECIMAL               |
| Short text (names)         | VARCHAR               |
| Long text                  | TEXT                  |
| Date                       | DATE                  |
| Date and time              | DATETIME or TIMESTAMP |

#### Example Table With Different Data Types

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(150),
  salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
  hire_date DATE
);
```

In this example:

- `id`: stores whole number IDs
- `name`: stores text names
- `email`: stores email addresses as text
- `salary`: stores decimal currency amounts
- `hire_date`: stores the date the employee was hired

---

#### Summary

- Data types define what kind of data each column can store.
- Using the correct data type improves performance and data accuracy.
- Common categories: numeric, string, date/time.
- Always think about what type of data you need to store and choose the type accordingly.
