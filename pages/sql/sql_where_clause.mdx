# WHERE Clause

The `WHERE` clause in SQL is used to **filter the rows** returned by a query.

By default, when you run a `SELECT` query, MySQL returns **all rows** in the table.
If you want to retrieve **only the rows that meet certain conditions**, you use a `WHERE` clause.

---

### Why Use WHERE?

- To find **specific records** in a table.
- To limit results to only those that match a condition.
- To avoid retrieving unnecessary data.
- It can be used with `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` queries.

---

### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Example Table: `students`

| id  | name         | age | email                                         | enrollment_date |
| --- | ------------ | --- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1   | Alice Smith  | 20  | [alice@example.com](mailto:alice@example.com) | 2025-06-23      |
| 2   | Bob Johnson  | 22  | [bob@example.com](mailto:bob@example.com)     | 2025-06-20      |
| 3   | Carol Thomas | 19  | [carol@example.com](mailto:carol@example.com) | 2025-06-21      |
| 4   | Dan Green    | 23  | [dan@example.com](mailto:dan@example.com)     | 2025-06-19      |

### Example 1: Simple Numeric Condition

Select students who are older than 20:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age > 20;
```

---

### Example 2: Exact Match (String Condition)

Select student named 'Alice Smith':

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE name = 'Alice Smith';
```

---

### Example 3: Date Comparison

Select students who enrolled after June 20, 2025:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE enrollment_date > '2025-06-20';
```

---

### Example 4: Multiple Conditions with AND

Select students who are older than 20 **AND** enrolled before June 22, 2025:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age > 20 AND enrollment_date < '2025-06-22';
```

---

### Example 5: Multiple Conditions with OR

Select students who are 19 years old **OR** named 'Dan Green':

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age = 19 OR name = 'Dan Green';
```

### Operators You Can Use in WHERE

| Operator   | Meaning                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `=`        | Equal to                            |
| `<> or !=` | Not equal to                        |
| `>`        | Greater than                        |
| `<`        | Less than                           |
| `>=`       | Greater than or equal to            |
| `<=`       | Less than or equal to               |
| `AND`      | Both conditions must be true        |
| `OR`       | At least one condition must be true |

---

### Important Notes

- Text and dates should be written inside **single quotes** `'...'`.
- You can combine multiple conditions using `AND` and `OR`.
- Parentheses `()` can be used to control the order of evaluation when combining conditions.

---

### Summary

- `WHERE` helps filter the data returned by a `SELECT` query.
- It can also be used with `UPDATE` and `DELETE` queries.
- You can use various operators and combine multiple conditions.
- Learning to use `WHERE` effectively is an important skill when working with SQL.
