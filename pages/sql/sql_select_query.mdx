# Basic SELECT Query

The `SELECT` statement is the most commonly used SQL command. It is used to **retrieve data** from one or more tables in a database.

Once you have inserted data into a table, you use `SELECT` queries to view, analyze, and report that data.

---

### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

- `SELECT`: specifies which columns you want to retrieve
- `FROM`: specifies the table from which to retrieve the data

---

### Example Table: `students`

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  age INT,
  email VARCHAR(150),
  enrollment_date DATE
);
```

Assume we have inserted some data into the `students` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age, email, enrollment_date)
VALUES
  (1, 'Alice Smith', 20, 'alice@example.com', '2025-06-23'),
  (2, 'Bob Johnson', 22, 'bob@example.com', '2025-06-20'),
  (3, 'Carol Thomas', 19, 'carol@example.com', '2025-06-21');
```

### Example 1: Select All Columns

```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
```

- The `*` symbol means "all columns".
- This query retrieves all columns and all rows from the `students` table.

Result:

| id  | name         | age | email                                         | enrollment_date |
| --- | ------------ | --- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1   | Alice Smith  | 20  | [alice@example.com](mailto:alice@example.com) | 2025-06-23      |
| 2   | Bob Johnson  | 22  | [bob@example.com](mailto:bob@example.com)     | 2025-06-20      |
| 3   | Carol Thomas | 19  | [carol@example.com](mailto:carol@example.com) | 2025-06-21      |

---

### Example 2: Select Specific Columns

You can retrieve only the columns you need:

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM students;
```

Result:

| name         | age |
| ------------ | --- |
| Alice Smith  | 20  |
| Bob Johnson  | 22  |
| Carol Thomas | 19  |

---

### Example 3: Rename Columns (Alias)

You can rename columns in your result using `AS`:

```sql
SELECT name AS student_name, age AS student_age
FROM students;
```

Result:

| student_name | student_age |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Alice Smith  | 20          |
| Bob Johnson  | 22          |
| Carol Thomas | 19          |

---

### Example 4: Simple Calculations

You can perform basic calculations:

```sql
SELECT name, age + 1 AS next_year_age
FROM students;
```

This shows each student's age next year.

---

### Important Notes

- Every SQL query must end with a **semicolon (;)**.
- Column names in `SELECT` can appear in any order.
- You can mix columns and expressions in the same query.

---

### Summary

- `SELECT` is used to retrieve data from a table.
- `SELECT *` retrieves all columns.
- You can select only specific columns.
- You can rename columns and perform basic calculations in your queries.
- `SELECT` is the foundation of all data retrieval in SQL.
